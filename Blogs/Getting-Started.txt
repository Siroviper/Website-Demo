My First Blog Post - Getting Started

> Posted: November 19, 2025

Welcome to my blog! This is just a short example entry to show you how blog posts work on this site.

## What This Blog Is About

I'll be writing about my creative journey, sharing thoughts on writing and art, and documenting my experiences. Think of this as my personal journal where I can ramble about whatever's on my mind.

## Getting Started

Setting up this blog has been an interesting experience. I wanted something simple and personal, with that terminal aesthetic I love. No fancy frameworks, just pure HTML and CSS doing their thing.

Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best ones. This whole site is just static HTML files, and honestly? It's perfect for what I need.

## What's Next?

I'll be posting updates whenever inspiration strikes. No schedule, no pressure—just writing when I feel like it.

Thanks for stopping by!
