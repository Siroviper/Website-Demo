===CHAPTER1===
<p>A cloudless night, the full moon illuminated my jail cell as the cool air of October seeped through the bars of the cell's window.</p>

<p>I laid on the uncomfortable bed trying to sleep, using my hat to block the faint light of the moon and the oil lamp that sat on the Sheriff's table across the room. Next to the lamp there were a rifle and three revolvers, my guns.</p>

<p>The bed lacked any sheets—or pillows for that matter, but my poncho, colored in a dark shade of blue and decorated with a white pattern, provided enough warmth for the chilly nights of autumn. I was used to sleeping in the open, as expected from an outlaw like me. My hat was a dark wide primed one, with a crow's feather sticking out of it. A gift to remind me of someone I dearly missed.</p>

<p>The Sheriff wasn't here, instead his deputy took his place, he was a young fellow, a year or two younger than me. He wasn't the talkative type, not that I wanted to strike a conversation with him anyway. He sat with his legs on the table, reading a book showing no concern to me, it was too far and too dark to get a proper look on what he was reading. He seemed disinterested in me, I reckon outlaws are dime a dozen to him. A book would be more interesting than a filthy bandit who'll be executed by tomorrow.</p>

<p>Drifting to sleep was nigh impossible, as if the bed was made to ache your back so bad to the point it won't let you sleep. And the smell, it didn’t help, the whole station reeked of tobacco, although the deputy wasn’t smoking himself.</p>

<p>Soon enough the door opened, and a gust of cool wind crept in, "Howdy kid," a man greeted the deputy, I lifted my hat, it was the Sheriff, he was carrying a piece of paper in his hand, he was an older fellow, slightly on the shorter and fatter side, his face was decorated with graying mutton chops and a wide brimmed white hat rested on his head. "You're free to leave now."</p>

<p>The deputy lowered his legs and put a piece of paper in his book and closed it, "Thank you sir," he stood up. "Have a good night." he said.</p>

<p>"You too, kid" he patted him on the back as he left. Now it's just me and the Sheriff.</p>

<p>"Kids and their books these days" he turned to face me, his hands behind his back "Doing nothin' but readin' all day", I lowered my hat again. The Sheriff wasn't pleased with my gesture. I wasn't in the mood for talking to anyone, especially to lawmen. He walked to his desk and pulled the chair loudly before sitting, trying to annoy me or get my attention.</p>

<p>"A fine collection you got there." The Sheriff said, I forgot his name, not that it was important to me. "this old navy you got, it's a nice piece,"</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said. It was an old gun once owned by my old man, it saved his life during the war against the confederate boys. That's why he wanted me to have it. I converted to shoot cartridges instead of the old cap and ball. Despite the modernization, it was still slow and impractical under the stress of battle, so I kept it for good luck. But instead of saving my life, it was the gun to destroy it.</p>

<p>"Robbing a bank on your own? And <em> almost </em> getting away with it?" he put too much emphasis on almost "That's impressive I gotta say, you got grit, Mister <em> Jack </em>," the way he said my name, as if he was mocking it, he wasn't convinced that Jack was my real name. "but grit alone is not enough to save a man"</p>

<p>"Thanks for the compliment, partner" I replied, my hat remained on my face</p>

<p>"But you know what's buggin' me?" I heard him picking up one of the pistols, opening and closing the cylinder. </p>

<p>"What?" I sighed, half expecting the next question</p>

<p>"A Krag rifle, bolt as smooth as butter," he cycled the bolt two times, making sure I heard it, "two new colt army. All marked as properties of the army. Now, how come a common outlaw gets his hands on army issued guns?"</p>

<p>"My guess is good as yours," I replied </p>

<p>"How I see it, there's two possibilities, none of them are in your favor" he wasn't amused with my snarky response</p>

<p>"The first, you crossed paths with the army at some point or another, it didn't go well for the army boys, and you, as the scoundrel you are, stole their guns. Continuing to wreak havoc in this beautiful country."</p>

<p>"But that didn't happen" he added, "the other option, which I think is more plausible, you were in the army, and something had happened, causing you to desert." He was so sure of himself. "And you stole those guns and became an outlaw."</p>

<p>I remained silent, not because he was wrong, he was spot on.</p>

<p>"Now the details of who you are don't interest me, <em> Jack </em>, as I'm here to give you an offer."</p>

<p>I lifted my hat and stood up from my lying position, "an offer? What kind of offers?" Something was sketchy about it, he wasn't doing this from the kindness of his heart.</p>

<p>"The kind a man in your position can't refuse," he said pointing his cigarette at me, lighting it before continuing "let's not kid ourselves, by tomorrow either you'll be hanged or perhaps shot, who knows. Or you could do this job, and earn your freedom."</p>

<p>"You want me to do your dirty work in exchange for my freedom?" I asked, leaning forward.</p>

<p>"It's neither my job nor dirty, it's quite righteous if you ask me." he replied, "you heard of what's going on in the Ozarks and bayou?"</p>

<p>"More or less" </p>

<p>"Good, so you know about how the federal government quarantined those areas after the plague spread. No one goes in or out without the government and USHC explicit permission." </p>

<p>"And what does that have to do with me?" I knew about a plague in the Ozark region, the Hunters' Corps were secretive about it, never revealing the true extent of the plague when I rode with the army.</p>

<p>"The Hunters Corps is in need of every able bodied man they could get their hands onto to fight the plague, they're allowing criminals among their ranks, offering outlaws, such as you, a pardon, in case they survived, of course" they way he framed it seemed like my survival wasn't guaranteed, far from it, implying my death was certain.</p>

<p>"And you, my dear <em> Jack </em>, you're a killer" he added, "your instinct wasn't of a thief, to run with the loot, but that of a soldier, to stand tall and fight your enemies." A Sheriff complimenting a criminal that just killed two and wounded three lawmen earlier that morning?</p>

<p>"Pardon? The people after me wouldn't give a damn about a pardon, even if it came directly from the president himself, he wants me dead for killing his brother."</p>

<p>The Sheriff raised an eyebrow, scratching his chin pretending to think, "well, in that case, I know someone that would help you escape to Mexico, no one would find you there, the money you'll get from the huntin' trip would be enough, although barely, but enough to get you across nonetheless."</p>

<p>I leaned back against the wall, "my options are, to either wait here to get hanged, or go and do your job in a cursed land, and torn to shreds by unholy demons?"</p>

<p>"<em> Might </em> be torn to shreds by unholy demons," he said as if he was correcting me, "and let's be honest, do you really have a choice in the matter?"</p>

<p>"What's in it for you? I don't reckon you're doing this from the kindness of your heart" </p>

<p>"Saving wretched souls like you," he said, "the commission I get is a just bonus for my good deeds" he said with a sly smile, of course it's about money, it's always been about money.</p>

<p>He stood up with the piece of paper in one hand and the lamp in the other, and walked towards my cell "all you have to do is sign this contract", waving it around, "and you'll be on your way to freedom"</p>

<p>"Or my demise." I said, he didn't seem to care and he handed me the contract with a pen.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he replied, "and sign it with your real name <em> Jake. </em>"</p>

<p>I didn't reply, I stood up next to bars to read the contract with the aid of the Sheriff's lamp.</p>

<p>It read that my crime would be pardoned, and I would earn my freedom after, and only after, the contract is fulfilled and whatever I'm tasked into hunting is delivered to the United States Hunters Corps. In case I try to flee before that, I'll be shot by the hunters I'm accompanied with. I would get paid half the regular Hunter wage with no compensation if we failed the hunt. The United States Hunters Corps is not responsible for any physical injuries or mental distress after the contract is fulfilled. And lastly, if I ever so desire to join the Hunters' Corps afterward, I would be granted a place in it with the full benefits of a professional hunter. As if I would want to spend the rest of my days battling beasts in cursed lands.</p>

<p>I don't really have a choice in the matter, as much as it pained me to admit it, he was right. I sighed and signed my name at the end of the contract. I handed him the paper back, I felt defeated.</p>

<p>"Thanks for doing the sensible thing, Mister…" he took a look at my name, a big grin drew on his face "Connor O'Riley," he chuckled to himself "I knew I was right. Make sure to not kill your officer this time, believe me, you don't want to be alone without a professional at your side in the Ozarks, and you don't want to be on the Corps' bad side"</p>

<p>"I'll keep that in mind," that bastard still haunts me to this day. He got what he deserves, I don't regret killing him, I would still do it knowing where it would send. </p>

<p>"I'll be assigned to a team, right?" I asked "what would stop them from recognizing my name and selling me to the army right away?"</p>

<p>"Your name would be known only to the higher ranking officer, <em> Jack </em>, you don't have to worry about Baker or anyone from the army, you'll be gone before he reaches you"</p>

<p>"Now if you excuse me," he put the lamp back on his desk, "I'll have to send the paperwork to the Corps, it usually takes two to three days," he left the office, slamming the door behind him, leaving me alone, sitting on the uncomfortable bed.</p>

<p>I looked at my guns, the navy's barrel was pointing at me, judging me. This old navy witnessed the horrors of war with my old man and shall witness the horrors of the hunt with me soon. The thought of my father lingered in my mind. The once proud soldier of the union got his reputation and legacy tarnished by his son who killed an officer of the army and turned into a common bandit, preying on the meek, just to survive for another miserable day.</p>

<p>I brought great shame on the family’s name. I wish I could see him one last time, to beg for his forgiveness.</p>

<p>I sighed, thinking about what would happen next, in a couple of days I'll be in cursed woods fighting unholy abominations, and if I survive, I'll be on my way to Mexico, to live in hiding for the rest of my life, that's if the Sheriff was true to his words.</p>

<p>I removed my hat and rested it on my lap, contemplating the feather. I spent the last four years or so on the run as an outlaw, does she still remember me? Will she accept me as an outlaw? If I even decided to return to her, would she agree to run to Mexico with me? Abandon everyone and everything just for me?</p>

<p>I was once seen as an agent of law and order. Now they're hunting me down like a common bandit. This is not how it was supposed to be, I was meant to serve in the army, like my father once did. I'm a righteous man, or that's what I like to call myself.</p>

<p>I sighed and laid on my back. My hat shielding my face again. Fortune smiled at me one last time, I escaped death once again, even though I desired it this time. Now I got another chance at freedom, another chance to see you again. Don't forget about me, like how I never did, dear Lillian. I'm coming soon, I promise.</p>
===CHAPTER2===
<p>"To be captured alive." My briefing read, I didn't like these words one bit, but my position as a "Gray Coat" —hunters speak for convicts— stripped me from the privilege of picking and choosing my contract. They gave me a red armband and a Gray Coat, hence the name, similar to the ones the Confederate boys once wore. Thankfully they allowed me to keep the poncho, they didn't object as long as it showed the gray colors and the arm band. So I wore it like the gunslingers of old— hanging high on my shoulder and pinned back enough to reveal the armband, my drawing arm and revolver.</p>

<p>They assigned me under the commands Lieutenant Leonhard and his best men, or rather man and woman, Oskar and Olivia, they were siblings, might as well been twins for all I know, they look nearly identical.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had rough features with a sun kissed complexion. His eyes were always squinting, focused on the task at hand. He wore dark pants and a dark blue coat, it looked black under the shade of trees, with an armband indicating his rank as lieutenant of the USHC. The ranks were similar to the ones in the army, a white hat rested on his head with the pin of the Hunters corps insignia right in the middle, two swords stabbing a canine skull of some sort.</p>

<p>The siblings had dirty blond hair and pale blue eyes. The brother had a scar on his lip, giving him an intimidating look, while his sister had freckles all over her face, it gave her a cutesy look, not that I cared to admit it. Both wore similar outfits to their lieutenant, the same dark blue coats with similar armbands and white hats with the USHC 's insignia on them.</p>

<p>Their attire wasn't what really caught my attention, it was their weapons, we were all armed with Krags, but theirs were different. Unlike mine, an old wooden and well-worn rifle, theirs were made entirely out of steel. All the wooden parts were replaced with a skeletal steel frame. It looked bizarre, it made them look sturdier, and perhaps lighter, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>The three of them were leading the way while I trailed behind, the brother was carrying a strange looking bear trap, it was larger than any trap I've ever seen. Instead of one, it had two rows of sharp, oversized steel teeth. A steel chain wrapped around his chest like a bandolier was connected to the trap. His sister too carried chains and ropes, same with the lieutenant, which he also had a map compass at hand. Our destination was a small waterfall deep in the forest, a spot our target frequented for drinking.</p>

<p>And for me, I was carrying the bait, a lamb. Its mouth was tied, occasionally struggling trying to baa, but the gag prevented it. </p>

<p>I petted the poor fellow trying to calm him, "shh" I told him, it felt like comforting a crying child. He relaxed a bit, looking me in the eyes as if he understood me. I chuckled, hugging him tightly but gently, "you and me, we ain't so different," I said softly, "we're both walkin' to our slaughter. At least you don't know it."</p>

<p>"Gray Coat," the lieutenant barked at me, "quit playin' with the bait." The siblings were staring at me, Olivia snickering to herself, while contempt was drawn all over Oskar's face.</p>

<p>"This is the man they sent us?" Oskar said to the lieutenant, he was annoyed, "how many times have we told them we want professionals, not fools." </p>

<p>"He's a cracked shot," Olivia replied, still smiling to herself "or that's what they say."</p>

<p>"I sure hope he is, cause if he missed a shot," he said while rising one finger "he'll be dinner for the monster in no time"</p>

<p>"Enough with this." Replied Leonhard dryly, "we have a job to do."</p>

<p>"Speaking of which..." Oskar began whispering to the lieutenant and his sister. I couldn't hear what they were saying, not that it concerned me. I’m here to do a job and be on my way.</p>

<p>We continued walking in the forest, the lieutenant was visibly annoyed with whatever Oskar was whispering "enough," Leonhard raised his hushed voice, he was angry, "now is not the time for it!"</p>

<p>Oskar was about to say something but pursed his lips.</p>

<p>We marched for hours, the forest was relatively empty and quiet, no animals, no birds, only crow cawing in the distance and a couple of undeads roaming the ground. The scouts must've missed these two or perhaps they wandered here. It didn’t matter, as we dealt with them swiftly and pressed on. </p>

<p>As time passed, I grew warry, I still don't know what we're exactly after, the contract only stated it was a "skull beast" which didn't give the slightest hint of what we—<em>I</em> was up against.</p>

<p>I quickened my pace a little until I was next to Leonhard. "Lieutenant, if you don't mind me asking," I said, trying to hide my uneasiness, "what are we huntin', exactly? The briefing I got only said it was a 'skull beast' but it didn't say what it was, or how it differs from a regular beast, heck, I don't know what a normal beast is even like."</p>

<p>"There's nothing 'normal' about them beasts," the lieutenant replied, "they were once humans, you see, but this demonic plague changed them, it affected everyone differently, some might turn up like those undeads you saw earlier, a minor inconvenience for an experienced hunter. Or they might end up as vicious beasts,"</p>

<p>"Like werewolves?" I asked, the undeads didn't frighten me, they were slow and mindless, a dog would be more threatening than those creatures.</p>

<p>"Calling them 'werewolves' is understatement" he replied, "while some beasts might align with your idea of werewolves, they're not shapeshifters, and not necessarily wolves or humans either. But this one we're after is similar to your idea of a werewolf" he said that as if it would make it any better.</p>

<p>"Beasts vary wildly, especially skull beasts, they might look like two animals made into one, or a crude parody of the human form" he added "their flesh is rotten away it shows their bones and skulls, hence the name. They're more vicious, unpredictable and dangerous, we used to kill them on sight."</p>

<p>"Used? What changed?" I asked </p>

<p>"Unfortunately for you, you're a Gray Coat" Oskar replied, "only USHC Hunters are permitted to know." he said it proudly, like it's an exclusive club. </p>

<p>Olivia rolled her eyes "that applies to you too, Oskar, always trying to impress the new recruits and Gray Coats" she giggled to herself, she was cute, not that I cared to admit it </p>

<p>"Oh shut up" she got on his nerves.</p>

<p>"Both of you shut up," Leonhard barked at the siblings. They went silent but Olivia was still snickering. "Only officers are have access to classified informations" he said it matter-of-factly</p>

<p>"And how were these beasts made?" I asked, not sure if I truly wanted to know.</p>

<p>"We're not sure yet." Leonhard replied, "We only have speculation, the most popular theory is that they get cursed and infused with other creatures, not the most scientific explanation, but we're not dealing with science here." as if it was scientifical it would've made it any better.</p>

<p>"And the second one, is that there's a being of some sort that tries to mimic life, but keep failing, instead creating the abominations we're huntin'"</p>

<p>"Do you believe them?", I asked, noticing Oskar looking at me weird, he seemed disdained with the lieutenant entertaining my curiosity</p>

<p>"How they’re made doesn't concern me, my only concern is sending those monsters back to the hell that spat them out."</p>

<p>"fair enough" I replied with a nod, and that was the end of our conversation.</p>

<p>I was wondering how this will end, contemplating all the decisions I made that might or might not made me end up here, I always heard about this hunting business happening in the Ozarks and Bayou, but never paid it any attention, saying it would never affect me, it's far away and there's people who took it upon themselves, people like Leonhard, who’s eager to fight it, why should I concern myself with it? And here I am, thrown against my will to fight demons I never imagined to see.</p>

<p>I wasn't a stranger to the world of hunting, far from it. My old man and I went on hunting coyotes and deer in my younger years. But now, we're not hunting mere coyotes or a buck. This is life and death against an unknown beast and I might not be ready for it. I'm walking to my own slaughter.</p>

<p>We pressed on, we were getting closer and closer to the beast's favorite drinking spot. I could hear the sound of a waterfall in the distance.</p>

<p>We had to climb a small slope to get to our objective. It wasn't that high, but having both my hands occupied with a lamb that was trying desperately to escape my grasp made climbing a hassle. The three were ahead of me once again, I could see Oskar whispering again. We marched through the woods. The trees were thicker than before, as we walked I noticed a crow was following us, or rather me specifically, his eyes were pinned at me, staring at me never letting me out of his sight. Every time I passed him, he flew to the next tree to stare even more at me, he took an eerie interest in me. A sign of bad omen for some, but it reminded me of Lillian and her pet crow we used to play with. Her feather decorated my hat.</p>

<p>We found a baby crow on the edge of the woods we used to play near as kids, we didn't know how to tell if it was a boy or a girl, but Lillian insisted it was a girl because it looked like one, it kind of did so I didn't argue with her logic.</p>

<p>The poor creature was screaming at us, trying to intimidate us, it only made her look even cuter than before. Lillian carefully picked her up, making sure not to hurt her, she screamed louder at us and we laughed, she calmed down eventually after a while and we spent the rest of that afternoon searching for her mother and nest, but we couldn't find them anywhere, I suggested we should delve deeper in the woods but Lillian was scared. The woods always scared her, I told her I'll protect her from whatever is hiding in the woods, but she said she didn't want me to get hurt. We gave up on our mission to return the crow, Lillian—always the kind-hearted and benevolent—raised the little crow like it was her daughter, naming her 'Alice', and Alice saw her as her mother, always by her side everywhere she went. She became our best friend. Alice loved climbing on our shoulders, sadly the poor girl didn't know how to fly, never got the chance to learn how, but she was a clever girl, acting like a person more than a bird most of the time. I miss both of them.</p>

<p>How long was it? Almost ten years since the last time I was in my hometown? Four since our last letter, before I went on the run and became a common outlaw. I missed my mother—God rest her soul—and Lillian dearly. I considered going back, but it would've been foolish, it would be the first place they would search for me. Army boys and spies would be waiting for me at every corner if I dared to come back.</p>

<p>Four years ago, the last letter Lillian sent, she told me she was finishing her studies to become a doctor like her father. Funny how the both of us wanted to be like our fathers, me with the army and her with medicine. At least her passion is more pure than mine. She probably finished with her studies by now. I wonder where she is, if she still remembers me or simply moved on. After all, we haven't seen each other for the past ten years, since we were kids.</p>

<p>I chuckled to myself, I remember promising each other to get married once we got older, I wonder if she still loves me and remember that promise, after all this time, after what I did. Would she still love? Would she agree to come with me to Mexico? The outlaw life doesn't suit her. Never suited me to begin with.</p>

<p>The sun began to set, orange light cascading through the leaves, the air got colder as we got closer to the waterfall, we reached the spot before the daylight completely disappeared, we've been walking for almost the whole day. The lamb was sleeping at this point.</p>

<p>It was beautiful, the ground was covered in tall green grass and a colorful array of flowers, it smelled as pleasant as it looked, a mix of flowers and earthy scent, it seemed comfortable to sleep on the grass, and there was plenty of shade under beautiful trees to sit under, and the water was surprisingly crystal clear. A perfect spot for a picnic, I could see why the beast frequented this spot.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stashed the map in his coat's pocket and looked around before pulling a watch.</p>

<p>"We have roughly half an hour of daylight, set the trap up next to that tree." He said pointing at the tree near to the water, it was an old tree with a thick trunk. Noticeably thicker than the rest. He might've, and rightfully so, been concerned that the beast might pluck the tree in its frenzy.</p>

<p>"With me, Gray Coat," Oskar commanded. I went with him while his sister gathered some leaves and twigs to camouflage the trap.</p>

<p>Oskar threw the chains and trap next to the tree, kneeling to probably untangle the chain. I used the rope I had to tie the lamb to the tree. When I finished, Oskar commanded me to help him set the trap up. I knelt next to the trap, Oskar facing me and each one of us held the steel maws tightly and pulled down as hard as we could, it was awfully stubborn. With a click the trap was primed and ready. It could sever a man's leg clean off with that much force.</p>

<p>"What if it just severed the beast's leg off?" I asked </p>

<p>He looked at me as if I asked the stupidest question "it won't," he replied dryly.</p>

<p>Olivia returned with the leaves and tree branches, spreading them on the trap, not leaving a single spot visible. I hope this works.</p>

<p>The lamb was still sleeping. I moved him slightly to be in front of the trap, I hoped he would stay asleep through this whole ordeal.</p>

<p>It was getting dark already, The lieutenant gestured to us to get closer, and when we got, he pulled a small ammo box from his satchel, it contained odd looking ammunition. The tip was made of glass instead of lead. The glass tip contained a purple substance of some sort. Oskar and Olivia took five rounds each.</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked, as I took five as well</p>

<p>"Sleeping rounds, the tip is filled with a special concoction, one dose is enough to put a man in deep slumber, six or eight for beasts." He looked around at the trees before directing his speech to Oskar, "those trees seem comfortable enough, you two get in position while I get behind that rock" pointing at a rock up on the waterfall.</p>

<p>"Do I climb a tree or go with you?" I asked, unloading the regular rounds from my rifle and loading the sleeping rounds in their place</p>

<p>"You stay here" the lieutenant replied dryly</p>

<p>"What?" I blinked, he can't be serious.</p>

<p>"Got stones in your ears? You stay near the trap,"</p>

<p>"You're insane if you think I'll—"</p>

<p>"Do as you're told, Gray Coat" he interrupted me,</p>

<p>"Or perhaps he prefers a rope around his neck" Oskar joked with a big shit-eating grin on his face.</p>

<p>They're deliberately screwing me over, fucking with me, in any other circumstance it would have ended up with a brawl or bullets flying, I wanted to draw my revolver at him, I wanted to kill them where they stand and run from this suicide mission, my hands were itching to draw my guns, the poncho hid my left hand, I could draw my other pistol and take them by surprise.</p>

<p>I could shoot two of them but the third would definitely get me before I could aim my gun at them. My hands relaxed, "fine" I said, grabbing my rifle tighter, I'm here in the first place because I killed my officer, killing another one won't solve anything, heck, it might even make it worse. </p>

<p>"both of you get in position" the lieutenant commanded the siblings and went to climb the slope to get to his position behind the boulder and take cover, Oskar helped his sister climb her tree and he climbed the one adjacent to it afterwards.</p>

<p>I was standing alone in the open, "fine, to hell with me." I muttered to myself and took cover behind a tree, hoping it hid me well enough that the beast won't notice me. It was far away from the trap and had two shrubs next to it, helping to conceal my position a little bit. It had a branch low enough to rest my rifle on it. All four of us had a clear sight of the trap. All we had to do was wait until the beast revealed itself.</p>

<p>Damn them all, the siblings were safe up there in their trees while the lieutenant was far a way up the waterfall, while me, poor me is sitting next to the trap, it's intentional, they want me dead, I should've ran when I got the chance, it's too late for this now, they have a clear shot of me if I tried to make a run for it, and if I managed to escape, the beast or other unholy abominations might find me before leaving the forest.</p>

<p>The forest was getting darker and darker, the half moon barely illuminated the hunting ground, waiting was dreadful, not a single sound could be heard, the eerie silence was deafening. All I can do now is just wait. The dread was killing me.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>We waited for what felt like hours, it was hard to tell time during the night and I didn't have a watch on me, I kept scanning my surroundings for anything, not a single sound, not a single creature in sight. The only thing I could hear was my heart bounding frantically, and the only thing I could see was the lamb still sleeping. </p>

<p>I saw something moving in the corner of my eyes behind the trees, I aimed my gun to where I saw the shadowy figure, it was as silent as the night, it kept appearing and disappearing behind the woods, my heart was pounding harder and harder, trying to escape my ribcage. </p>

<p>I took a deep breath to calm myself and focus. Panicking would make things worse.</p>

<p>The lamb woke up from its sleep, it started baaing and screaming for help, running in circles trying to escape, but it all was in vain, the rope stood in the way. It must've seen the beast, I aimed my gun at the general direction of the lamb, for a while there was nothing. I kept my gun trained, waiting for a sound, movement, a sign of anything. But there was none.</p>

<p>After a while I saw something, something terrible. First it was a claw emerging from the shadows, knife-like in appearance, wrapped around a tree, each claw was almost the same length as a bayonet, if not longer. Then the hand—if you can call it that, was revealed, freakishly long fingers attached to those claws, they were connected to large hand, crudely resembling a human hand, then the thing revealed its face, I was met with the white ivory of a skull, a wolf's skull stained with red with exposed flesh on the edges. It had the sinister grin canine skulls tend to have. It looked around with its hollow eye sockets, wolfish ears standing up ready to hear the grass grow, it sniffed the air a couple of times with its nonexistent nose, before going to the lamp, little by little, with each careful step it took, the beast revealed itself furthermore. As I expected, it had a humanoid body, but all the proportions were wrong. A crude fusion of man and beast. It was walking on all fours like a wolf, its arms long were human in appearance, while the legs were more animal-like in appearance, like the one you would find on a wolf. Walking on it deformed, long clawed toes. Its entire body was covered with long, dark fur, with a hint of white and gray. The thing was huge, at least twice my size.</p>

<p>And lastly, the beast tail swung lazily behind it, surprisingly the most normal thing about it, it looked like a normal tail one would find on a dog or wolf, but longer and larger with the same long fur that covered its body.</p>

<p>I was terrified, almost paralyzed by fear, the poor lamb was even more terrified, his screams got louder, movement more erratic, disparately trying to escape his demise.</p>

<p>The beast approached the lamb and trap with big and careful steps, each step as silent as the night. It went completely over the trap, fuck, shit.</p>

<p>It stretched its claws and grabbed the lamb by the neck, the fellow kicked and screamed harder, desperately trying to escape, another claw wrapped around its body. With swift motion, it yanked the lamb's head off, putting an end to its frantic screams.</p>

<p>It held the lifeless body up high, with it maws wide open, it drank the blood. Painting it fur and boney maws with red, filling the air with the rustic scent of blood and death. It began devouring the lamb whole, the sound of bone breaking and flesh tearing was nerve-racking, this might be my fate if the plan failed, and it appeared to have failed, as the beast didn't step on the trap, did it know? It was impossible for it to know, it was just bad luck, it must be, it had to be.</p>

<p>After the gory display, there was nothing left of the lamb, just a trail of blood as an evidence for the crime, the beast licked its bloody maw and claws, its tongue was freakishly long. It went directly to the stream to wash down its supper.</p>

<p>Its legs missed the trap once again. Fleeing might be the right decision now, the trap failed, not once, but twice, my hunting mates didn't shoot, even if they did, it might—and probably will— have enough strength to maul me once it saw where the shots came from.</p>

<p>My heart was pounding harder and harder, trying to burst out of my chest with each pump of blood. I took a step back, the thought of retreating was getting more appealing by the moment. This wasn't a hunting expedition, it was an execution. <em>MY</em> execution. To hell with them. I had to save myself, the beast was busy quenching its thirst, giving me it back. It was my one and only chance if I wanted to escape.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully I began to retreat, keeping the beast in my vision. I didn't dare to breathe, each stepped measured and silent not to alert the beast as I inched back. And what I feared happened—my boot crushed a twig hidden in the grass, an audible snap disturbed the dreadful silence. The beast raised its head from the water, and twisted it like an owl to the source of the noise. My eyes met with the empty sockets of the beast. It took a step towards me, I was frozen, fear paralyzed me, I wanted to shoot, to run, to fight back, to hide, to kill, but couldn't do anything, the only thing my body was able to do was just standing there as it slowly approached me.</p>

<p>Time felt slow, the deafening silence once more, the beast saw me, it will do to me as it did to that poor lamb. All the decisions I made, all the crimes I committed led me to this moment, this is my divine punishment, this is how it ends, mauled by an unholy abomination, no one to remember or mourn my death. I closed my eyes, not wanting it horrid face to be the last thing I see.</p>

<p>A metallic snap followed by a howling, horrible scream broke the deafening silence of the night. The beast had stepped on the trap. A volley of three shots followed in no time, the echoing booms of gunfire snapped me back to reality. I raised my gun and fired too. Almost instinctively, Four shots were fired. The beast shrieked in pain, but it was still standing, it tried prying the trap open with its free hand and legs.</p>

<p>Another volley. Eight shots, and the beast is still standing, and roared stronger, both in pain and in rage. The so called sleeping bullets seemed to only make it angrier.</p>

<p>Twelve shots, the beast is not showing any signs of giving up, with great force it broke the trap’s maw in half and looked at me, deep in the empty sockets I saw the flickering of eyes, filled with primal rage. A rage directed at me. It rushed towards me with rage fueling its fire. Panting and somewhat dazed, the concoction is working but it wasn't enough to stop it.</p>

<p>Another volley, sixteen shots. We had one round left each. The beast showed no sign of stopping despite its dizziness, it charged towards me with a vicious snarl, I cycled the bolt as fast as humanly possible but it wasn't fast enough, before I could close the bolt it jumped on me, pinning me to the ground. It opened its bloodied maws wide open trying to tear me apart, it aimed for my neck, I raised my rifle, blocking its awful attacks, stopping the sharp fangs from meeting my tender skin. I kicked and struggled as much as I could. As if that freak show wasn't enough, inside the beast's ivory maws it had a human mouth missing its lips. Unholy infusion between man and beast.</p>

<p>"SHOOT IT," I cried, my strength began to tremble, the sharp fangs getting closer and closer to my neck "FOR FUCK'S SAKE SHOOT IT" the beast flung it claws at my face, trying to kill any resistance left in me, I moved last moment, only scarring my left cheek, I screamed of pain. Nineteen shots. The beast's strength began to dwindle, it couldn't keep up, its breathing became slower and heavier, but still awake, I still had one round, this was my chance. I gathered all my remaining strength and smacked the beast's head with my rifle stock—breaking it in the process. The beast stumbled back, giving me an opening, I aimed my broken weapon to the beast's chest and squeezed the trigger. Twenty shots, the last shot. The gun almost escaped my grasp without the stock to absorb the recoil. </p>

<p>The beast collapsed and fell next to me. I collapsed on the ground as well, my breaths were laborious, my heart felt like it was exploding, my face covered in the warm blood, it hurt and burned like hell. I looked next to me, the beast was breathing slowly, it didn't try to attack me again, just staring at me, with its oddly human eyes, before falling into deep slumber.</p>

<p>"Good job, Gray Coat" said Oskar from his tree, "we thought you were a goner" there was a mocking tone in his voice. As if he was trying to contain his laughter. He jumped off the tree and went to help his sister down, while she didn't need the extra help, he was happy to offer it. The lieutenant returned from his spot as well.</p>

<p>"Four or six rounds would be enough, you said!" I shouted at him, "it almost mauled me down there!" I pointed at it with my rifle.</p>

<p>"And it didn't," Leonhard replied with irritating calmness, "some beasts are more resistant to our concoctions, that's why we carry extra rounds, this one however, was extraordinarily resilient. Fourteen rounds was the previous record."</p>

<p>I blinked, "What causes a monster to be extra resilient?" I asked him, standing up, my legs were shaking, my face burned as blood dripped on my boots and staind my poncho and coat, my broken rifle still in my hands, that explained the metallic frame, I thought to myself.</p>

<p>"Size mostly, but sometimes smaller monsters could withstand multiple doses," he replied. He took a bottle from his satchel and gauze, pouring it on the fabric before handing it to me, "cover your wounds before they get infected, and don't worry, you won't turn into one." I took it and thanked him. </p>

<p>I placed the alcohol soaked gauze on my wound, it stung badly, I kept holding it with one arm while the other rummaged through my satchel to get some bandages, I wrapped them around my mouth and tied it, leaving my nose exposed to breathe. I saw Olivia looking at me and chuckling, not a mocking one, rather an endearing one, it was sincere and joyful.</p>

<p>"what?" I asked with a smile,</p>

<p>"You look silly," she said</p>

<p>"A man almost dying is a funny sight to you?" I joked, the wrap muffling my voice slightly, it made me realize that she can't see my smile.</p>

<p>"No, not at all," she replied, "I'm happy you're alive—"</p>

<p>"Come and help us with the beast," Oskar interrupted his sister, "leave him be, he's not worth talking to anyway."</p>

<p>She sighed, "I know, but…" she was hesitant, "I'm sorry, I'm just sorry." she said with a sad voice. What puzzled me is that she had a mocking tone earlier, but now she seems more empathetic. It doesn't matter, we're almost done, all that is left to do is chain the beast and get it to the wagon and I'll be a freeman, the scar was the proof that I fought and won. </p>

<p>I grabbed a chain and shackled the beast's arms and legs, it reeked like wet dogs and rustic blood. When we finished we began pulling the chains while the lieutenant led the way, the beast was exhaustingly heavy, the uneven terrain made the task even more back-breaking than it already was. Each pull was harder and laborious than the last, it ached my entire body. I felt weak after the near death experience earlier, but the prospect of my freedom energized me to press on. We walked in silence for what felt like hours. I could see the lantern lights of the wagon that awaited us in the distance.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stopped and raised his fist in the air gesturing us to stop,</p>

<p>"something wrong—" I asked before feeling a sharp sting in my neck</p>

<p>"Nothing personal, pal," Oskar said with a venomous voice. "But the army boys will pay good money for your head." I elbowed him as hard as I could. He grunted in pain.</p>

<p>I drew my gun and turned to face him, he was holding an empty syringe. My vision became blurry, my mind hazy. He drugged me. "You son of a whore—" I pulled the trigger, but his blurry figure didn't bite the dust.</p>

<p>He looked at himself then at me, "can't shoot straight huh?" he said before kicking me in the chest, sending me to the ground next to the beast. Facing the blooded ivory, I tried to stand up but my bones felt like they were melting, my muscles betrayed me. I laid on the ground struggling to breathe. Oskar was laughing and mocking me, I couldn't hear what he was saying, I couldn't move and all I could see was the beast, its eyes were open, they were filled with great sadness. Oddly human eyes, oddly familiar eyes… I thought to myself before drifting to unconsciousness.</p>

<p>“SHIT! IT’S AWAKE!” a voice screamed followed with a deafening howl and steel chains shattering.</p>

<p>Everything fades to black…</p>

===CHAPTER3===
<p>Horses banting, hooves beating loudly and a half dead man screaming in pain lies in the wagon.</p>

<p>"DRIVE FASTER! FASTER GODDAMN IT!" I barked at the driver, trying to hold Leonhard's arm as best as I could with a broken arm, while my sister took a bullet out of her belt. We laid the lieutenant inside the cage meant for the beast. Resting his head on my coat.</p>

<p>"THE HORSES CAN'T GO ANY FASTER! HYAH!" the driver shouted back, hitting the horses with the lash, but they didn't go any faster. At this rate he'll die on the road.</p>

<p>"Hold him still," she said as she removed the bullet's tip with her knife, pouring gunpowder over the bite wounds on his arm. She struck a match and lit the powder, a blinding flash illuminated the wagon for a brief moment, before returning into darkness, our lieutenant shrieked in pain.</p>

<p>The entire wagon smelled of rust, smoke and burnt meat. </p>

<p>"You good back there?" the driver asked.</p>

<p>"WHAT DO YOU THINK!" Leonhard screamed back, "for fuck’s sake give me something for the pain." he cried to us.</p>

<p>"Hand me some Morphia" Olivia commanded, her voice shaking, trying to hold it together.</p>

<p>I went to grab the lieutenant's satchel and it hit me, it wasn't there, "Where is it? Where's his gear?!" I asked, searching the wagon making sure I didn't miss it. There were two satchels in here, mine and Olivia's but I couldn't find his anywhere.</p>

<p>"Look for it! It must be here somewhere!"</p>

<p>"It's not! Goddamn it, did we forget it?!"</p>

<p>"THE FUCK YOU MEAN IT'S NOT HERE," Leonhard screamed harder, "THE PAIN WILL KILL BEFORE I BLEED OUT!"</p>

<p>"What?! It was on him when we carried him to the wagon, r-right?" she replied, the lieutenant cried in pain as she tried desperately to put his intestine back in their place, pressing on his abdomen to keep them in. Leonhard screamed in agony.</p>

<p>Officers were entrusted with Morphia and medicine, we weren't allowed to carry them. I went through the events. </p>

<p>First the beast woke up and broke its restraints, then it attacked us, slammed me to a tree, breaking my arm before mauling poor Leonhard. It took Connor with it before disappearing in the forest. We carried him as fast as we could to the wagon—as fast as I could with my damn arm. I remember seeing the lieutenant's satchel was on him when we dragged him to the wagon. But I don't remember seeing it when we placed him here, shit, did we drop it without noticing?</p>

<p>"We have to work on him without Morphia" I told her. "We have to make do with what we have."</p>

<p>"YOU GOTTA BE FUCKIN' KIDDIN' ME!" the lieutenant screamed which quickly turned into a wail of pain, his intestines were spilling out, carrying him back—trying to keep his guts from spilling—was nigh impossible, but we managed it. Oliva pressed on his abdomen.</p>

<p>"This is not going anywhere, I can't take the pain anymore." he exhaled laboriously, shaking from the pain.</p>

<p>The lieutenant grabbed my arm, "Oskar! Hit me!" he cried, almost like he's begging me.</p>

<p>"What?" he took me by surprise</p>

<p>"Knock me out! I can't take the pain no more," he tightened his grip, "do it!"</p>

<p>I was unsure at first, but he asked—commanded me to do it. I looked at Oliva, she was as dumbfounded as me, but she nodded, it's this or she can't continue working on stabilizing him.</p>

<p>"HIT ME!" he screamed and I complied, punching him as hard as I can with my good hand, His head dropped on the wagon's floor, before waking up again "I TOLD YOU TO KNOCK ME OU—" Before he could finish I punched him harder than before, his head hit the floor once again, this time, he didn't get up.</p>

<p>Olivia put her ear on his chest, checking if he's still with us, she sighed in relief "He's still breathing," she straightened herself and rested his head on the coat.</p>

<p>"Hand me the bandages" she asked again, I gave her all I had in my satchel, and she started wrapping his abdomen, they quickly turned red.</p>

<p>"Is that what they teach you in huntin' school?" the Shotgun asked mockingly, "remind me not to get injured around them hunter boys." He laughed to himself</p>

<p>"Hush! This is not the time for this sort of jokes!" the driver hit the Shotgun on the head, he wasn't pleased with the shotgun's snarky comments.</p>

<p>I wanted to hail threats and insults at him, but we had more pressing matters to deal with, Leonhard state was far from stabilized. My sister continued wrapping his wounds.</p>

<p>It was a miracle we survived, although the lieutenant was barely 'surviving', I wasn't sure if he'll make it. I only ended up with a broken arm while Olivia was unscathed, thank God. </p>

<p>"It's not enough, give me another roll," I gave her the remaining bandages from her satchel. The beast slashed his stomach wide open and bit his hand as he tried to shoot it, almost ripping it off. His abdomen was covered in bandages, all soaked in red and swollen, his arm was torn to shreds and thanks to us, burned to crisps, but at least we stopped the bleeding. We didn't cover his arm, we wanted to save them all for his guts.</p>

<p>She wrapped them over the blooded bandages, but they weren't enough to cover his wounds.</p>

<p>I tried to remove my shirt, but my broken bone failed me. "Help me with it, we need to stop the bleeding" I grunted from the pain.</p>

<p>She removed my shirt and tore it, using it as makeshift bandages, wrapping them around the old ones, still, it wasn't enough.</p>

<p>I looked at the driver and his shotgun, "give your shirt, quick!" I barked at him, he gave a weird look.</p>

<p>"Give him the damn shirt, Bill." the driver said.</p>

<p>The shotgun cursed under his breath as he unbuttoned his shirt, "here" he said with disdain and threw it back at me through the cage's bars. I took it and didn't bother thanking him.</p>

<p>Olivia tore it and covered the bandages, they quickly turned red, she checked his pulse and breathing again. </p>

<p>"That oughta slow the bleeding, his breathing getting slightly better, but he's losing a lot of blood, if we don't make it in time he might die."</p>

<p>"MAKE THEM GO FASTER, HE'S DYING ON US BACK HERE!" I barked at the driver again.</p>

<p>"We're going as fast as we can! Hyah!" The driver whipped the horses, but our pace didn't get any faster, it was a race against the clock, and I'm starting to feel we're losing it.</p>

<p>I sat helplessly beside my sister, she took her coat off and covered me. I told her to keep it, but she insisted, saying I was shirtless and it's cold. I thanked her.</p>

<p>I looked at our lieutenant, we did the best we could, only if we didn't lose the medicine and Morphia… this whole ordeal could have gone smoother. What happened earlier, how did it wake up? It was supposed to sleep till kingdom come with that much drug in its system. This thing almost killed the Lieutenant and stole our bonus. I hope he suffers under its hands as much as Leonhard suffered.</p>

<p>"Let me see your arm," my sister said softly. I gave it to her, and she began examining, it was bent slightly around the midsection, it ached like hell. She touched the broken area.</p>

<p>"Easy there, don't press too hard" I exhaled.</p>

<p>"Sorry," she pulled her hand away, "Does it hurt when you move your fingers?"</p>

<p>"A lot," I replied.</p>

<p>"It looks bad, I'm not sure if I can set it back here, I might even make it worse," she said defeated, "we'll have to wait until we're back at the fort." </p>

<p>We were trained in this sort of situation, when everything goes to hell and we get separated from the group, or be the sole survivors. performing basic first aid until help arrives or crawl back to civilization. It seemed counterintuitive not to give us small doses of Morphia but that was the rules. </p>

<p>She sighed and hugged me, "I'm glad it was just a broken arm and you're ok."</p>

<p>I returned the gesture, "I'm glad you're safe too."</p>

<p>The wagon continued its bumpy ride, while we monitored the lieutenant. His breaths were laborious, but he was still alive, barely. It could've been me or her, to be the one bleeding and fighting against death. But it was him, as much as I liked our lieutenant, I was glad it was him. As selfish as it may sound, my heart couldn't bear to witness my dear sister in this deplorable condition.</p>

<p>No one talked during the way back.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>We arrived at Fort Misery by dawn, Such a fitting name, the lieutenant was still unconscious, it was for the better I told Olivia.</p>

<p>Many forts across the country were built—or repurposed—to serve as a headquarters for hunters' operations, Fort Joy in the bayous down south, Fort Hope atop the Colorado mountains, and our Fort deep in the Ozarks woods.</p>

<p>The fort was built in 1868, after the southern rebellion was crushed, the union facing a new threat, one of abominable demons rather than man. The walls were high and mighty, erected to withstand cannon fire, at the time they weren't yet sure what they were up against, it was better to take the precautions anyway. Watch towers inside and outside the fort were manned all time, vigilant and ready to shoot wandering undeads, or foolish bandits who lost their way.</p>

<p>After the plague swept the land, every poor soul was forced to evacuate the land, some didn't like the idea of abandoning their property, the federal government had to persuade them with money, or force, for the more uncooperative folks. No one was allowed in or out. It was just hunters, monsters and bandits trying to strike it rich, hindering our job, stealing our targets and killing fellow hunters. We had shoot on sight orders if we encountered any bandits, a generous bonus awaited us for each bandit we killed. Anyone not wearing our colors was considered a bandit, a free game and a free bonus.</p>

<p>The fort's gates opened as they saw our wagon approaching, half a dozen men were waiting for us, they were expecting us to come back with a triumph, with the greatest hunt of the century, but instead we came back with a half dead man, I wished we came back empty handed instead.</p>

<p>They asked what happened and where's the beast, when they saw Leonhard's terrible state, they realized they didn't want to know. His right arm torn to shreds with sharp teeth marks all over it, almost exposing the white and charred bones, the smell of burnt flesh still lingered in the air. His belly was covered in a thick layer of bandages and clothes, all stained in brownish red color. </p>

<p>They helped the half dead man off the wagon and carried him to the fort’s hospital. I followed them because my arm needed fixing too. It ached like hell.</p>

<p>As soon as my legs touched the ground, my leg betrayed me and I fell face first to the ground, crying in pain, my sister immediately jumped to help me.</p>

<p>"What happened?" she was worried,</p>

<p>"Damn it, I think my leg is broken," I cried from down there. It didn't feel broken earlier, the rush must've masked the pain when we carried Leonhard.</p>

<p>"Easy now, the doctor will fix it." She helped me back on my feet, and we limped to the doctor.</p>

<p>We sat in the doctor's office while they sent Leonhard to the emergency room. We did our best to help him, we bought him some precious time. I hope the time we borrowed was enough to save him.</p>

<p>I told Olivia it's ok she could go and relax now but she insisted on being by my side. I didn't argue any further, it would've been useless anyway. She was always this stubborn.</p>

<p>We were exhausted, we didn't—couldn't sleep last night, after the rush went off my arm ached like hell, while I hadn't noticed my broken leg that night, my arm alone made sleep impossible, as time went by, the pain progressively only got worse and worse. And Olivia didn't sleep either, the lieutenant demanded her attention the whole trip back, making sure he was breathing and temperature from blood loss.</p>

<p>"You think Lieutenant Leonhard would make it?" she asked, fidgeting with her fingers.</p>

<p>"You did your best to save him back there, he's a resilient man, he will make it, he always did." I patted her in the back, trying to make her feel slightly better about herself. I wasn't sure if he would make it out of this, I looked at my good hand, the hand I punched the lieutenant with, it still hurt from that punch, bruised and slightly swollen, covered in blood, my entire arm was covered in blood, his blood. I sighed. Thank God it was him and not her.</p>

<p>We didn't wait for long as the clinic's door opened shortly. It was the doctor, he was a man in his late twenties with a well-groomed dark moustache and short hair, he wore a dark bow tie and a white shirt, "Morning doc Barrett." I greeted him, he was one of many doctors at the fort. He was the one assigned to our group.</p>

<p>"Morning Oskar, Morning Olivia." he replied, "It's been a while since your last visit."</p>

<p>"I was planning to keep it that way." I replied, trying to lighten the mood a little.</p>

<p>"I hoped so," he smiled before going to the medicine cabinet, "I heard what happened to poor Leonhard, everyone at the fort won't shut up about it." he picked a bottle before facing me, "I suppose it's one of your secret huntin' missions that us normal folks are not allowed to know."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," I replied, "Corps' rules." Only hunters were on a need-to-know basis for missions, they didn't want any more rumors or hysteria to spread like the early days.</p>

<p>"As expected," he replied, "so, what do we got here?"</p>

<p>"He broke his left arm and leg." I was about to open my mouth, but Olivia beat me to it.</p>

<p>"Hmm, I could see his arm is slightly deformed," tell me something I don't know, "can you move your fingers?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He sat the bottle on the table next to me, it had a syringe and other surgical tools. He began feeling my arm starting from around the wrist, "does it hurt when I touch it?" </p>

<p>"slightly, it mostly hurt around the bent area" I pointed at the midsection where it hurt. He gradually went up, I inhaled in pain when he reached near the broken area, "right here, in the middle" he felt it for a little bit longer</p>

<p>"It seems to be just a single fracture," he picked a syringe and filled it from the bottle, “Fixin' it won't take long. Just a simple realignment.”</p>

<p>He injected the needle directly in my vein, and the sharp sting immediately vanished.  "Do you feel it?" He waited for a few seconds before asking.</p>

<p>"I do," the pain relief was immediate, I couldn't feel my entire arm like it wasn't there, the rest of my body felt numb.</p>

<p>What in the bottle wasn't regular morphine or anesthesia, the Corps made its own specialized concoction, it was both at the same time, when injected it causes loss of sensations and when drank it worked like a strong painkiller and of course we weren't allowed to know how it was made or what was in it. </p>

<p>They called it 'Morphia', it had similar effects to morphine but without being addictive, but it seems they couldn't get rid of the dizziness effects from the regular morphine, this drug also made wounds heal faster and less likely to get infected. As long as it did its job, and did it well, I didn't care what they put in those syringes.</p>

<p>The Corps also had "enhancement drugs" that were… more experimental, less stable and prone to cause dangerous addictions with continued use and unknown side effects. They weren't ready yet. We're not even supposed to know about them yet. Just stuff me and my sister eavesdropped behind officers' backs. We might get in trouble if they discover we were intruding into their conversations.</p>

<p>"I'll begin realigning the bone, tell me if you feel anything" the doc said, I could feel Olivia holding my good hand tightly, it almost hurt but the drug numbed the pain. She was more nervous than I was.</p>

<p>With great force, the doctor pulled my arm and with a click he put it back in its place, I didn't feel a hint of pain during the procedure.</p>

<p>"Did it hurt?" he asked, feeling my arm again, making sure the bone is in its proper place, I shook my head, I didn’t feel a thing. He took two wooden pieces from under the table and put them on my arm, "could you hold them please?"</p>

<p>Olivia let go of my hand as soon as she heard the doctor. I held the wooden pieces in place, he took some clothes and wrapped them tightly around my arm and the wood. I couldn't feel how tight it was, but it didn't look too tight to the point it was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"We're done with your arm, don't move it for at least two to three months, now for your leg" he started working on my leg, thankfully it didn't need resting like my arm, it was just a mild fracture. After he was done, he got me a crutch and a small bottle, "Take this, just a spoonful if the pain gets unbearable" he handed it to me.</p>

<p>"I'll remember that. Thanks Doc" I said to him and stood up, Olivia was there to help me, I was already getting dizzy from the drug.</p>

<p>"Take it slow, Ozzie" she helped on my feet as I tried the crutch.</p>

<p>The Clinic's door flung open, catching us all by surprise, "here you are, the Hunt Marshal was looking for you" it was Jasper, a fellow hunter and the Marshal's right hand.</p>

<p>"Can't it wait for later? I could barely think straight from the Morphia, just tell him me didn't capture the skull beast—"</p>

<p>"It's not about the failed hunt, although he's furious about it, it's about Jack." he said, expecting me to know this name, Jake? Who's Jack?</p>

<p>Olivia whispered in my ear "he means Connor, the Gray Coat that was assigned to us."</p>

<p>"Oh right, Jack, what's about him?" I hope the beast ate him alive.</p>

<p>"I don't know but there's an army general with the Marshal and he wants Jack." Jasper replied.</p>

<p>General Joshua E. Baker is here? I looked at Olivia like we're in trouble. "Can't let the General wait," I said, "you can go Olivia, I'll handle this."</p>

<p>"And leave alone in this state? I'm coming with you." I wanted to argue but didn't have the strength for it, I just let her have her way.</p>

<p>We followed Jasper to the Marshal's office. If the general is personally here, it can't be good, and I don't know if I could stay lucid for the whole meeting, let alone the way.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>Outside the Marshal's office four armed men stood at the door, they weren't hunters, they wore army colors. I did my best to limp up the short stairs with my sister's aid. I was feeling tired already.</p>

<p>Jasper opened the door for us but didn't follow.</p>

<p>"And here he comes… one of our best hunters." Marshal Caleb greeted us, trying to hide his disappointment as soon we stepped in, it was apparent from his tone he was expecting someone else. The Marshal was an older man in his mid-forties, long graying hair with a short beard and a big mustache that would put most to shame, he wore a white shirt and a vest in the dark blue color hunters are known for, a silver badge hung on his heart, instead of a star a regular Marshal would typically wear, it was a circular badge with a beast's skull in the middle, "Hunt Marshal" written around the skull. The badge carried the weight of absolute authority in the Fort, the Marshal's word was law, and the law was final.</p>

<p>"Take a seat," the Marshal pointed at the empty chair in front of his desk, adjacent to General Baker. Which wasn't so pleased with us—me especially, disgust drawing all over his face. I sat down, my sister grabbed an empty chair and sat next to me.</p>

<p>"That's him? That's Lieutenant Leonhard?" the General spat out in disdain, he was around the same age as our marshal, perhaps older than him. His face lacked any facial hair one would expect on a general or a soldier, opting for a clean-shaven look, his features, despite his age, were still sharp, his eyes still burning with the same rage he was infamous for.</p>

<p>"No… I'm… Oskar Ritter, and this is my sister, Olivia Ritter. We're Lieutenant Leonhard's professional hunters… his best." I said, trying to make a good impression. But he wasn't impressed, he looked like he wanted to smite me where I stand.  </p>

<p>General Baker was famous, or rather infamous, for his cruelty and ruthlessness; after the war had ended, Confederate militias and guerrillas were too stubborn to surrender after their rebellion had failed. A young no-name general was tasked to deal with the Rebel boys and any outlaw associated with the confederacy, quickly his name was widespread among rebels and outlaws alike across Missouri and the south.</p>

<p>Any captured rebel was treated worse than slaves, he took every opportunity to set an example for whoever dared to rebel against the union. Crucifying entire rebel camps and leaving them for the crows, forcing prisoners to duel each other to death like the western stories of old, "freeing" rebel prisoners by throwing them in the middle of nowhere with nothing to survive off and leaving them for dead. Both his men and enemies feared him.</p>

<p>"What is this? You told me you'll get the officer, not your common poachers" he waved his hand pointing at us, the Marshal too was disappointed with our arrival, especially in that state, the drug started to kick in, I'm not sure if I could stay during this. "And what's wrong with him?" he asked</p>

<p>"He's on Morphia," my sister replied.</p>

<p>"could he continue?" the Marshal asked</p>

<p>"Yes, yes I can." I said, collecting myself "during the hunt, there have been some… complication, to say for the very least." he raised an eyebrow, as if he was asking me to continue, trying to remember what happened "we had this Gray Coat with us, his name's Jack" I pretended to not know who Connor was, as me and my sister agreed to. "He… uh, set the beast free, so he could escape." </p>

<p>"He did what?!" The Marshal's eyes were wide open. The general rubbed his eyes, cursing under his breath something I couldn't hear.</p>

<p>"He wasn't pleased with the 'half wage' bit in the contract," I continued, "and we… had an argument about the payment, saying he risked his life and deserved more, one thing led to another, and he… shot the chains and startled the beast. Before we could react, it woke up and attacked us. The Lieutenant got the short end of the stick, to put it lightly."</p>

<p>"And Jack? What happened to him?" the general asked, rage and disappointment boiling in his eyes.</p>

<p>"He… ran away, deep in the forest." I said sheepishly. I was getting dizzy, trying my best to stay awake.</p>

<p>"Great." the General rubbed his eyes again and sighed, "Just great, when we almost had him, he slipped once again, and it's your fault and your little poachers' club." he stood up, "go deal with your animal while I deal with mine."</p>

<p>"What do you think you're doing?" the Marshal asked, standing up too.</p>

<p>"Finishing my business with O'Riley" he stood before me, "where did <em> Jack </em> run from and where to?" he asked me.</p>

<p>"This is classified—"</p>

<p>"Don't hit with your horseshit excuses, I can get arrested for interfering with army business, now, and please answer, where did he run from and to where?" he asked, trying to appear professional. He was trying to threaten us.</p>

<p>I pursed my lips, I could see the Marshal with the corner of my eye, his expression screamed "DON'T", I knew how important this beast alive was, but didn't know why, I couldn't risk the army killing it searching for their general's petty revenge.</p>

<p>He stared at me and my sister, trying to intimidate us but we didn't budge. "Fine, I'll find him myself." he looked at the marshal, "next time, if there's a next time, I expect you to inform the army right away instead of harboring deserters and killers." he left slamming the door behind him as his farewell. His men followed and they all rode away. Jasper entered as soon as they left.</p>

<p>I sighed once he was gone, I knew it was an empty threat, the army doesn't have any real authority over hunters. Only the Marshal has. Which Looked furious now.</p>

<p>"This damn idiot, he will ruin everything!" He kicked his chair, breaking it, "and you two, get out of my sight! Your incompetence sickens me!"</p>

<p>"Put all contracts on hold and summon every hunter and scout to Fort Misery, we need to find this beast before the army boys kill it!" he said to Jasper.</p>

<p>“Right away sir.” he left heading to the telegraph office.</p>

<p>This was our sign to leave, I stood up with my sister's help and left. This thing went somewhat smoothly, and they seemed to buy our story. I was half expecting to get discharged from how important this beast seemed to the officers, especially the Marshal.</p>

<p>"Isn't this abuse of power?" Olivia asked on our way to the Hunters quarters.</p>

<p>"hm?" I was too dizzy to probably focus.</p>

<p>"The general going after Connor, he’s using federal resources for his personal goals."</p>

<p>"It is. But he doesn't seem to care," I replied, "I heard he has some friends in the army that could pull some strings that allows him to pursue the fucker."</p>

<p>"Do you think he's alive?"</p>

<p>"Connor? The beast probably has eaten him by now."</p>

<p>"But don't you think it's strange it took him?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I looked at her.</p>

<p>"It could've easily killed us all there, but instead it just attacked Leonhard, and it didn't bother finishing him off before bolting away with Connor, it's strange."</p>

<p>"Hmm, it's really strange," I replied. I didn't want to think about this right now, my mind was getting hazy. I need to sleep. "But we shouldn't concern ourselves with it now, the Marshal would deal with the beast now, and the general would deal with Connor, if was still alive."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess you're right. Wanna eat something?" my sister asked. "I'm starving."</p>

<p>"No, I would rather sleep right now, go collect our money and get yourself a treat." I let out a big yawn. </p>

<p>We walked back to the quarters. We lived to see another hunt, it’s a shame we can’t be part of the big one.</p>

===CHAPTER4===
<p>It was getting dark and we still haven't found Alice's nest, the poor girl must miss her Ma by now, cawing and screaming nonstop since we found her.</p>

<p>"Conner…" Lili stopped, "I don't think we should go there," standing at the edge of the woods. We weren’t far from our houses or our playing spot, but we never dared to venture into the woods past the outskirts. She hugged Alice, scared something might snatch or hurt her.</p>

<p>"Don't worry Lili, I'll protect you both." I replied with confidence.</p>

<p>"Do you even know how to use that?" Lili asked, pointing at my right hand.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," I looked at the gun in my hand, my father's six shooter, it was an old navy, I think that's what he called it. But I don't remember taking it, he would be furious if he found out. The gun felt light, almost weightless, easy to manipulate and aim. Near the end of the barrel fifteen marks were haphazardly carved. My father told me he got fifteen rebels with this very gun.</p>

<p>Alice cried once again, almost startling Lili, "see, she’s crying for her mom." I encouraged her to venture into the woods with me.</p>

<p>"Pa would get mad at us…" she was hesitant, petting the baby crow.</p>

<p>"We'll be back before he notices that we're gone," or notice the gun I stole. I grabbed her by the hand and dragged her in with me, soon enough we were inside the woods and the sun disappeared behind the thick trees. We jokingly called it 'Dark wood' because of how dark and gloomy it looked. Our parents told us scary stories about the woods to keep us out. From wolves lurking at night to outlaws that kidnap and eat children. I didn't believe a word they said, but Lillian was frightened by them. Despite being high noon it felt like night here, the air was even chilly too.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes and ears open, her mom might be anywhere," I told Lili, but there was no response from her, "Lili?" I looked behind me, there was no one, how in the hell we got separated, I was holding her hand a moment ago, I felt it before turning around, before it disappeared to thin air.</p>

<p>"Lili? Where did you go?" I looked around for her, but she was nowhere to be found. A gust of cold wind ran chills down my spine, I was alone in the woods, all the spooky stories my parents told me suddenly became real. The thought of children-eating outlaws stealing her right from under my nose, I had my father's gun to protect me, but what about Lillian? I promised I would protect her.</p>

<p>I heard something creeping behind the trees, "Lili? Is that you?" no response, "come on Lillian that's not funny, come out." Nothing came from it. I raised my gun, almost automatically, at the source of that noise. "Lili?" This time the noise ceased when I called it. My grip tightened on the revolver, finger hovering over the trigger. </p>

<p>I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder, "Connie?" A familiar voice called behind me, quickly turning to face it, "What's wrong?" She’s back! And my gun aimed at her, her expressions were blank and unfazed with the six shooters in her face, like the gun wasn't even there.</p>

<p>I blinked and lowered the revolver, "where did you go?" I accused her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, perplexed by my question, "I was here with you the whole time."</p>

<p>"No you weren't—" I felt her hand back in mine, like she never left…</p>

<p>"Something wrong?" she asked again, concerned about my well-being.</p>

<p>"No," I shook my head. "Just stay close." She nodded in agreement. I swear she just disappeared into thin air and somehow returned like it was nothing. She scared me senseless.</p>

<p>We pressed on, the woods were as silent as the night, the creeping thing, whatever it was, didn't make a comeback, the only thing breaking the silence was the occasional sounds of crushed leaves and twigs under our heels.</p>

<p>"Did you find the nest?" Lili asked, at least she didn't vanish again.</p>

<p>"No, nothing yet," I answered, "Keep your eyes peeled, it must be somewhere up on these trees—"</p>

<p>I stopped, something was off, this is not what had happened. I didn't take my father's gun nor did we go to the woods. "Lillian?" As soon as I asked, my left hand felt empty. I looked behind me and she was gone. Those woods, they weren't the woods from our hometown. They were more ominous and sinister, the cold air had an eerie atmosphere.</p>

<p>"LILLIAN!" I shouted, I was alone again, "WHERE DID YOU GO! I'VE CAME BACK!" but nothing answered my cries, only the deafening nothingness, "where are you…" the air got colder than before, clouds left my lips with each word I exhaled.</p>

<p>The creeping sounds came back, I raised the gun instinctively at the woods, cocked the hammer and squeezed until the trigger gave. The thunderous boom echoed in the forest, I saw something moving—skulking between the trees. It wasn't human. The thing—unbothered with my shot—kept creeping around, never revealing itself.</p>

<p>The sounds, the sounds were coming seemingly from all around me at once, it—they began laughing and howling, I shot again at the laughter, they only got louder as if they were mocking me.</p>

<p>Trying to aim the revolver everywhere and at everything all at once, I was surrounded. I couldn’t count the exact number but there were at least a dozen sinister laughs, and I only got four remaining shots. I stood fast, ready to face the wilderness.</p>

<p>A vicious Coyote jumped out of the bushes with it maw wide open, I flicked my gun in an almost mechanical motion and fired. The Coyote bit the dust instantly, falling next to my boots. The thing wasn't quite a coyote, its head lacked both the fur and flesh, showing only the bones of its blood-stained skull. Before I could finish examining the thing, another one leaped from the shadows, catching my left arm in its boney maw, shredding the flesh and crushing the bone. The attack kicked my balance, almost causing me to fall. I fired at its skull, shattering it.</p>

<p>The laughter was only getting louder and louder, my misery was an amusing show to these daemons. The cold air hit the oozing wound, almost freezing the blood. I looked at my injury and my arm was… rotting. Flesh peeling away around the bite mark, the bone exposed, but it wasn’t white. I couldn't feel or move my hand and fingers. What the hell is going on?!</p>

<p>Another coyote lunged at me, biting me in the leg, the assault sent me to the ground. I retaliated with a shot to the skull and it dropped dead, I tried standing but my leg was already rotting away. The howling and laughter encircled me. Lying on the soft grass, my gun was ready to shoot anything that dared to show itself. I'm not going down without a fight.</p>

<p>"Why did you go?" A woman's voice called among the animalistic and hysteric rackets, they all came to an abrupt stop as soon as she spoke, I knew this voice. "Why did you leave me?" it called again, it was Lillian's voice.</p>

<p>A womanly figure revealed itself from the shadows, covered from head to toe in funeral attire, wearing a wide dark hat with a veil obscuring her face, and in her right hand, she was holding a piece, an old navy.</p>

<p>"I waited for so long, days felt like months, months turned to years, and the years, the miserable years became decades. I waited for you to come back, I waited like a patient dog for you." she said through the expressionless fabric, waving the gun around as she got closer with each word, "and like a dog I felt, I thought what we had was something special, it meant the world to me, but it seems you never really cared. You never came back."</p>

<p>"I'm back now! I never forgot about you—" I cried, crawling in the grass.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you Every. Single. Day. But you never wrote back," she said with fire burning in her voice, "Never responding to any of my letters, I told myself he would respond after this one. No, no, no this one will be different. He would write me back as he promised, he didn't forget about me, the letters just got lost on the way and they didn't reach him. He didn't forget about me, he still loves me, Connor wouldn't do such a thing, would he? He promised he would come back and we would have the loveliest wedding in the world." </p>

<p>"After this letter," her voice was shaking, trying so hard not to cry, "he would finally write me back, after he reads how much I missed and loved him," the coyote-things were following her, snarling and barking at me with their blooded, rotting skulls, "but you never did, you forgot about me, doing God knows what for all those years, drifting from town to town, whoring around and drinking. Robbing the innocent. I hated you. I hated you because I loved you, but you didn't love me." She raised her gun at me. I instinctively retaliated with my own, but my hand was empty, the cold iron that was in my hand moments ago had vanished—her gun… it had tally marks on its barrel…</p>

<p>"I miss you, Connie." She said softly, crying as she cocked the hammer.</p>

<p>"Wait!" I begged, raising my empty hand to shield my face, "I came back, here I am and I still love you—"</p>

<p>A flash and a sudden bang cut me short.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>I woke up from this horrible nightmare with my eyes wide open, but couldn't see a damn thing, drenched in sweat, feeling cold and with a splitting headache. A horrid—almost burning—smell assaulted my nostrils. The still warm air reeked of a horrible mixture of rotten flesh, blood and urine. </p>

<p>I was lying in a pile of what felt like leaves and pine boughs. What happened? Where am I? It was as dark as the night, all I could see was the pitch black nothingness. I need to leave, this place smells of death.</p>

<p>But my body was weak, my bones were melting and my muscles ripped from my slimy bones. A sharp pain in the back of my neck hit me. I placed my fingers where it came from, it felt like a small stab wound…</p>

<p>The event of last night came pouring in, I clinched my fist in anger, those fuckers, they were planning to betray me the second they saw my face. I stood up, my body was boiling, both from anger and fever, immediately collapsing face first on the cold and stony floor.</p>

<p>What in hell's name did they inject with? A faint moonlight broke through the darkness. Illuminating my surroundings ever so slightly, it appears I was in a cave. A cave filled with bones and carcasses of various and unrecognizable animals and… human remains. A half rotten head with its mouth ajar sat watching me sleep with its lazy—worm infested—eyes. Other human parts were scattered all around the place too, not sure if they all once belonged to that head. a torso with its guts spilled, flies and worms feasting upon it, an arm with its fingers ripped away, legs with all the flesh eaten away. I need to leave this graveyard before I end up like those poor bastards, defiled by a ravenous beast.</p>

<p>I gathered what little strength I had, but this time I managed to stay on my feet, although with great trouble. I used the walls to support my feverish body and limped toward the faint light of moonlight.</p>

<p>I dragged my feet on the stony ground with an agonizing pain, each muscle in my body protested with each step I took. What am I going to do now? Will I go far enough from here before the beast returns? I still had my satchel on me, I felt my right holster, I let out a sigh of relief, thank God I still have my gun and knife, and the left gun is still here as well, and the old navy still tucked in my belt, somehow it didn't slip away. I might not be able to run far with this fever, but I might be able to fight, but would small ammunition be enough for what awaits me? Something else puzzled me as well, why didn't it eat me right away? Was it saving me for later?</p>

<p>With great pain I finally managed to reach the cave’s entrance, one more step and I would be out of this damn place—I blinked and it was there, materialized from thin air, the beast we were after, now standing before me, towering over me.  In its right claw it was dragging a buck by the antler, throat ripped and still dripping of blood. On its right it was carrying… a broken rifle and a torn satchel. I looked up and was greeted with the sinister skull—a hat, decorated with a distinct feather sat on it head. My hat… Did this thing go back to get my stuff?!</p>

<p>"Hunter, Hunter awake" This thing could speak?! It exhaled those words with a weird double voice, it was a mixture of a lovely lady's voice and a vicious wolf at the same time, the wolf's voice was more dominant than the woman's. my right hand meekly hovering over my gun, I won't let fear overtake me like the last time, I won't go out without a fight.</p>

<p>I drew my Colt as fast as a feverish man could and squeezed the heavy trigger, but before I could pull it all the way through it grabbed my arm, lifting me in the air like a rag-doll, causing me to shoot the ceiling instead of this hellish creature.</p>

<p>I quickly reached for the other pistol with my free hand, but it grabbed it too before I got hold of the gun. Now hanging in the air by both arms. I kicked and struggled, but it was for no avail. It held me closer to its face—skull, its eyes piercing through my soul.</p>

<p>"Let go! Damn it!" I cried.</p>

<p>"No," it exhaled in a wolfish voice. "Don't shoot, hunter." it changed to the lady's voice, it had a sad tone to it, almost like she was begging me. The sadness in her voice was genuine. But it could be easily a trick to lower my ground. Could I trust this thing? I wasn't sure if that was the right call, but I didn't have a choice. I loosened my grip off the gun, the clang echoed in the cave. The beast lowered and let go. As soon as my feet touched the ground I fell to my butt, my legs were too weak to carry my weight, not sure if it was the fever or fear, probably both.</p>

<p>The thing took off the hat and gently placed it on my head, It huffed, almost like a chuckle, and clouds began to obstruct the faint moonlight, and darkness came once again. This thing was toying with me,</p>

<p>Before I knew it, sharp claws enveloped my sickly body, "Let go of me!" I cried, soon I was lifted off the cold stone again. I felt the sharp ends on my back, but they didn't hurt. The thing carried me gently, it seemed like it truly didn't mean me no harm. Not that I could resist anyway, too weak to struggle and my arms trapped in its grasp, I couldn't reach for the navy even if I tried.</p>

<p>It carried me back to where I started, carefully and gently it laid me on the makeshift leaves bed, as if I was a precious trophy.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?  Let go!" I couldn't see anything but I felt it hugging me, holding tightly to its body, the beast was lean and muscular, its fur was warm and soft, although reeking of wet dogs. I tried to push against it but it was futile. The beast was strong as hell.</p>

<p>"Hunter must rest," it hugged me to a tight embrace, my face pressed against something soft, not fur, but a pair of curves underneath the fur, unmistakably breasts… dear god, this thing is a woman?! My face got hotter, not from the fever. Don't think about it. It’s already awkward and absurd as is.</p>

<p>I remembered what Leonhard said about those beasts, some used to be humans, well, that explains the lady's voice, and the womanly features too. I hadn't noticed them earlier when that thing tried to kill me, but they were modest in size and hidden underneath the fur.</p>

<p>Her arms and legs around me, like it feared I might try escaping, a thought that never left my mind. My right arm was loose enough that I could reach for the old navy and shoot it in the heart. But I wasn't sure that would be enough to kill it. It hadn't killed me, <em>yet</em>. but if I shoot, it will. I must wait for a better time to escape, but where to run to? Could I trust this Sheriff? His idea almost got me killed, not from the beast, but by the hunters accompanying me, those backstabbing snakes. No, it was them that betrayed me not the sheriff, he will keep to his word, he should.</p>

<p>"Sleep," She said softly in the lady's voice, thinking of the beast as a "She" felt surreal, and sleeping with it only added to this fever dream.</p>

<p>But she seems to have forgiven and forgotten me for what I did earlier, not holding a grudge against me. </p>

<p>I'm sick, tired and cold, and she's warm and comfortable. I could feel her chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm with each time it breathed, I closed my eyes, hoping she wouldn't kill me in my sleep.</p>

<p>I drifted to a dreamless slumber, Thank God.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>I woke up to the sound of something breaking. This time the sunlight illuminated the cave and it looked as horrible and horrid as the night before. The Beast was giving me it back, hunched over and devouring the buck near the pile of rotten carcasses and bones, breaking the bones like hard candy and drinking their marrow.</p>

<p>Despite the strong smell, I slept surprisingly well. The fever is still there but slighter better than the night before. My throat was as dry as a desert, and my stomach demanded something to eat.</p>

<p>I stood up from my lying position and the leaves rustled under me.</p>

<p>The beast stopped wolfing her breakfast, twisting her neck at me like an owl. Immediately kicking in a fight or flight response, It crept towards me on all fours—my hand resting on the old navy under the poncho—claws and maw covered in blood and her dark fur stained with red. "You are awake." It exhaled with some excitement in her voice, grabbing the torn satchel that I hadn’t noticed was near her. I recognized the symbol on it, it was the satchel that Lieutenant had, what happened to them? Did it kill them? Thumb on the hammer.</p>

<p>The daylight—although faint deep in the cave—illuminated this creature better. The curves of breasts were somewhat visible under the long fur, one could only notice them if he was looking for them. It's still the same horrible daemon that tried to kill me from the night before, I think it was the night before. How long have I been out for?</p>

<p>It was absurd to think this horrible Beast was once a woman, the cursed bayonet-like claws, elongated limbs and deformed body, and the sinister wolfish skull, but nothing to hint of the lady it once was save for her voice which sounded like a vicious snarl half the time.</p>

<p>Sleeping with this thing was already awkward, now imaging the possibility that thing might've been a man made it even worse. The mental image of… I don't want to even think about it.</p>

<p>It's been a long, long while since the last time I had a company that didn't try to kill me in, now I have the company of a monster lady that tried to kill me, that, for some reason, took a liking to me.</p>

<p>She placed the bag in my lap, I looked at her and then at the bag, she wanted me to open it, so I did. It had a bottle of alcohol, bandage rolls and a small bottle labeled "morphia". Is this morphine? Why not just label it by its name.</p>

<p>"Remove it." She pointed her bloodied claw at my face. I recoiled in fear, and she retread her claw upon seeing my reaction, as if she didn't mean to scare me.</p>

<p>I had completely forgotten about my injury and the cloth on my face. I began unwrapping the bandages off my face. The dried blood glued the fabric to the wound and made it painful to pull. I took my canteen and poured some water to soften the dried bandages. She stared at me the whole time. The sharp blooded fangs in my face didn't help to soothe my nerves.</p>

<p>The bandages were dirty and soaked in blood, I could feel the wound still hadn't stopped bleeding. </p>

<p>Before wrapping my face again, I took some dried meat and bread from my satchel, the ration they gave me for the hunt, they expected the trip might last for a couple of days at most.</p>

<p>I wolfed down my sad breakfast and washed it with water. The meat felt like chewing on salted boots, and despite my best effort, the bread got stained with my blood after a couple of bites. Giving it a metallic taste, but I was too hungry to give a damn.</p>

<p>"Hunter," it said in the wolf's voice, "What is your name?" She asked. The question took me by surprise, I lowered the empty canteen and swallowed the stale mix of bread and water. I was about to say Jack, the name I went under for years, trying to lay low and hide from the world. I almost forgot my real name, "Connor, Connor O'Riley." I told the beast, there was no reason to lie and hide underneath fake names with her. She's a Beast, it's not like she would—or could—hand me over or snitch to the army.</p>

<p>Oh, the irony, the only thing least likely to betray me is the monster living in a cave in the middle of bumfucknowhere woods.</p>

<p>"Hmm, Connor, Hunter Connor." the lady said, nodding with her boney head. Yes that's my name, not sure about the title though, I've been called many things, none with a positive connotation. I haven't heard anyone calling me by my real name for a long time, save for bounty hunters and wannabes trying to make a name for themselves and cash the reward on my head, which only got higher and higher with each bounty hunter I sent to the undertaker.</p>

<p>I took a clean gauze from the satchel and soaked it in alcohol. I was about to cover my face with it but the creature stopped me, "drink it," the lady said with a hint of the wolf in her voice, tapping a claw at the small bottle.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked as if she would know, it seemed like morphine.</p>

<p>She stared at me, trying to think, or perhaps remember, but it seemed she didn't have an answer, "drink it," it tapped again.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's a good idea—"</p>

<p>"Drink!" it snarled, the wolf's voice more dominant now, I backed up, my hand under the poncho hovering over the navy. </p>

<p>"Please," the lady said, and stepped back with her tail between her legs, like it was ashamed for snarling at me.</p>

<p>I didn't want to risk making it angry, so I took the bottle and opened it, it was odorless like morphine. I put the cold bottle to my lips and I took a small sip, not wanting to wake up next year or overdosing on morphia, whatever the hell it is.</p>

<p>The burning sensation got lighter and less painful, my headache went away almost immediately, and I started to feel sleepy again. I took the bandages and hastily wrapped the alcohol soaked gauze on my face and leaving my mouth exposed. this time it didn't burn, I didn't feel a thing at all.</p>

<p>My body felt light and fingers numb, my eyelids heavy, hard to keep them open. The fever already made me tired, but with this god knows what medicine I couldn't stay lucid any longer.</p>

<p>"Connor, are you good?" she cocked her head, genuine concern was in her voice.</p>

<p>"I'm, I… I'm just a bit tired that's all—what are you doing?"</p>

<p>She laid next to me and held me into a gentle embrace. She's warm and comfortable, although it reeks of rust and wet dogs. I couldn't protest or argue, the fever and the drug prevented me. I accepted my predicament and closed my eyes. Hoping to wake up away from this thing.</p>

<p>Drifting to dreamless sleep once again.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>I woke up to the feeling of something wet pressing against my chest. I looked upon it and found a leaking buck's heart. The hell? Did it leave it for me? Speaking of which, I shoved it off me and stood up, scanning the cave for my unorthodox—and unwanted—companion. She was nowhere to be found, only the sight of the decapitated head staring into my soul keeping me company in the loathsome cave.</p>

<p>The fever is completely gone, in fact, I feel stronger than ever. The entrance wide open, sun beaming at my Colt and rifle where they fell last night, calling for me to reclaim them. This is my chance to leave and never see that thing again. Stashing the bottle in my satchel, it might come in handy. I walked to my revolver and holstered it. The rifle was… in a usable state. Only the stock was broken, but there was enough of it to hold it somewhat comfortably.</p>

<p>I picked the half-rifle and inspected it, pulled the bolt. Empty as expected but still functional, but might need some lubing. Let's see the ammo box… a bit uncooperative as always, the gun was getting rusty but I can still work with that. Now, for the pressing matter, testing how aiming feels without a butt, I raised the rifle trying to keep it steady as much as I could.</p>

<p>I sighed, it won't be effective for longer ranges, but something is better than nothing I suppose. I took some ammunition from my pocket, placing one in the bolt and dropping five in the box. Rearmed once again, I'm ready to embark.</p>

<p>I stepped outside the cave, the fresh air was a welcoming surprise, the still hot cave atmosphere made me forget how refreshing the breeze of October is. I took a deep breath, trying to figure out where to go now. I didn't recognize any landmarks—or rather the lack of any. It was just trees, trees, trees and more trees with the occasional bushes scattered between the trees. The cave was the only notable landmark in sight and it didn’t help</p>

<p>Where to go… I took another step to find my boots in mud, mud with multiple tracks, tracks made by the same creature, going back and forth from the cave and the woods. I knelt to inspect them, perhaps they could help give a rough idea where I should go.</p>

<p>The footprints heading out of the cave and rightward had sharper edges and flacks falling in them. Hmm, she must've left not long before I woke up.</p>

<p>There were two other tracks heading inside the cave, one is noticeably shallower and with rounded edges than the other, it was coming from the woods in front of me, it must have been made when she first carried me back here.</p>

<p>I got up now that I have a rough idea where to go, if I could reach the waterfall, I'll be able to leave this damn woods. It would be a long trip on foot but I could reach Valentine in a two weeks or so and find that Sheriff.</p>

<p>They probably think I'm dead, it would be safe to go back to the waterfall, they won't bother looking for a dead criminal, we're expendable to them, that's the whole point of that system.</p>

<p>I followed the trail and soon enough I was surrounded by the thick woods, the further I got from that graveyard of a cave the better. I kept following it till the track disappeared, I had a rough idea where to go, all I had to do was just keep an ear open for water sounds. As soon as I find my landmark I would make it back to civilization, to civilization that loathed me.</p>

<p>Getting there unnoticed might prove challenging, wearing the gray colors associated with convicts. I better hide the gray until I find something to replace it with, the nights are too cold and unforgiving without a coat.</p>

<p>Even if I got rid of the Gray, with how rugged and dirty I look, all stained in blood and mud, reeking of stray dogs and with this red soaked cloth on my face, I look like a man crawled straight from the grave. As soon as folks see—or smell—me they'll suspect something is up with this drifter.</p>

<p>Thankfully the road to valentine is enveloped in thick woods, I'll manage getting there undetected. But I don't have the money… The hunt failed and they were planning to sell me to the army. I might have to rob a stagecoach or some unfortunate souls on my way back. As much as I hated it, but this was my reality——</p>

<p>A gunshot, not far from me, interrupted my line of thought, a dangerously close gunfire, I hastily hid behind a tree big enough to conceal me.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot the undeads for fuck's sake," said an irritated older voice, "do you want to alert the entire woods of our presence?</p>

<p>"Look at those things!" said a younger voice, "I ain't getting into biting distance from those daemons!" Those men weren't hunters nor army, they were mercenaries, clad all in black save for the red bandana obscuring their features. There were just two of them, and a dog as their third. A large and gray hunting hound, which the older man got hold of his chain.</p>

<p>"The O'Riley is still out there and that daemon too, unless you want a bullet to the head or mauled to pieces, start usin’ your damn knife instead of hanging it on your hip like a fashion accessory!" said the older man, the young man didn't reply. They were about to go on their way but the dog stopped. It smelled something and began barking, barking in my direction.</p>

<p>"He picked somethin’," said the older man, with a hint of eagerness.</p>

<p>"And what makes you sure it's not another undead?"</p>

<p>"Only one way to find out." he let go of the chain and the hound came bolting to my position.</p>

<p>Shit, I drew my right revolver, running wasn't an option, this hound would catch me even if I had a head start, and I couldn't risk them following me back to Valentine, I had to deal with them here and now. I could hear the hound's frantic panting getting closer. </p>

<p>A single shot and a dead dog. "HE'S HERE! DON'T LET HIM RUN AWAY!" the older man barked, opening fire at my tree while the young man dashed to cover.</p>

<p>I don’t like killing, but there's no escape from this. The young man began advancing to my position under the cover of his comrades' gunfire. I drew both colts and cocked the hammers, I need to be as accurate as I can get. If I missed a shot, or was too slow, the other will definitely get me. I held both revolvers in my right hand and the broken rifle in the left. It was too slow and inaccurate for this job, but it will be of use.</p>

<p>Their footsteps were getting closer by the moment, steady and calculated, not a step gone to waste, taking turn covering while the other dashed. They were expecting me to make a run for it or retaliate with my own. But I waited. One of them is prone to make a mistake, and it seems it will be the young man.</p>

<p>Instead of a short dash he went rushing for the kill. This was my chance. </p>

<p>I tossed the rifle to a nearby bush, and the flanker took the bait, shooting at the bush, giving me a small opening. I leaned from cover and squeezed the light trigger. The shot landed straight in the man’s heart.</p>

<p>A shot nearly missing my face sent me back to cover, before his body could hit the ground, his fellow mercenary retaliated with a wild volley. Levering his Winchester erratically hopping a stray bullet may hit its mark by sheer luck alone.</p>

<p>A click of an empty tube signaling it's my turn to return the aggression, I emerged and aimed high, fear was in the man's eyes as he knew how it would end, hand on his sidearm but a bullet to the neck shut him down. And the man dropped to the ground. I was aiming for the head but he won't rise back up again. I holstered my guns and went to loot the man nearest to me, he had a shotgun, a Winchester's pump action with a full bandolier, that would come in handy. </p>

<p>I knelt to take off the bandolier, he won't need it anymore——a hissing sound and a flashing light caught me by surprise. The dead man's arm raised to the sky, flimsily holding a flare pistol before falling down again. Fuck! Fuck! Shit! I snatched the shotgun and bandolier and bolted off. I need to run, it doesn't matter where, I need to get as far away as possible from this place, they have backup! I can handle one or two, maybe three if I'm lucky, but if they're using flares that means they have multiple teams searching for me and now they know where I am! This is beyond me, I was lucky to stumble on the team of two. I need to leave before they get to me!</p>

<p>I dashed through the thick woods not knowing where I was heading, it didn't matter, all that mattered was that I had to get far—"HERE HE IS!" a man shouted, I ran straight to them! I jumped behind a tree with a thick trunk and crawled to cover as soon as he opened fire. The stomps of their boots getting louder and closer, I couldn't tell the exact number, but there gotta be at least half a dozen of them. I blindly shot the shotgun from behind cover, putting a stop to their advances.</p>

<p>"Connor! Connor!" one of the mercenaries shouted, "It doesn't have to be like this! We could end this without any unnecessary bloodshed! There's eight of us and only one of you! I advise you to surrender! It’s over!"</p>

<p>I wore the bandolier and checked the shotgun, ejecting the spent shell and inserting a new one in its place, "COME AND GET ME THAN!" I shouted back, filling the tube, "EIGHT, TEN OR THE ENTIRE ARMY! I DON'T GIVE A DAMN, I WILL KILL YOU ALL!", I knew I was fucked, beyond fucked, but keeping a facade of confidence might plant a seed of doubt in them. I can do this, the odds were against me, when haven't they? But I always managed to come on top, and I will.</p>

<p>"Have it your way!" he replied, cursing my name under his breath, "the three of you with me, the rest cover us—" their planning was cut abruptly by a horrible roar. "THE HELL WAS THAT?!" one of them said. Everyone was on edge, I was on edge, I knew what—or who—might it be and I didn't like it. Guns opened fired, but not directed at me. I held the shotgun tightly, ready for man or beast.</p>

<p>"BEHIND THE TREES!" a man shouted, before they unleashed a volley on what he saw.. "KILL THE DAMN THING!" their leader barked. All eight guns unleashed hell, shot after shot. They stopped, thinking they might’ve got the beast, but a deafening howl followed by the terrorized screams shattered their hopes. The thing came roaring and blood thirsty. I didn't dare stealing a glance from my tree. The horrible sounds painted a vivid picture of what was unfolding, of flesh tearing, of a man choking on his own blood, desperately gasping for breath, of another calling for his mother to save him, of bones cracking as a man screams. Their gunfire did nothing to stop that monster, only fueling its animalistic frenzy.</p>

<p>"FUCK THIS!" What remains of them threw their guns and raced out the cursed woods, whatever the amount they were promised, it wasn't worth it anymore.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before I heard their screams echo through the woods. And everything came to an abrupt stop, silence once again, as if nothing had happened, I took a deep breath, gathering every ounce of courage I had and dared to glance at the slaughter, shotgun still at the ready. But she wasn't there, all there was just the mangled remains of what was human, bodies ripped in half, the grass and trees painted in red, guts hanging from trees like ivy, crushed heads, crooked arms and legs barely attached to their bodies. The air had a sickening taste I couldn't stomach.</p>

<p>"Why did Hunter—Connor leave?" a distinct wolfish voice exhaled behind me, quickly, almost automatically, turning and aiming the gun at it. It stood unfazed with the gun right in its face, the white of its skull painted red and flesh sticking between its fangs, human flesh. "Should have stayed in the cave, safer there." she said in the lady's voice.</p>

<p>I gawked at the thing standing before me, my instinct begged me to pull the trigger, but I lowered the gun, "Where were you going?" she asked, "come with me." waving her claw to me to come. I just noticed that she was injured, her blood wasn't red, but a deep dark shade of crimson, three shots in the chest and two in her right arm. They looked painful, but it didn't seem to bother her.</p>

<p>"I can't go back," I replied, she cocked her head in confusion "I... I have to see someone, someone that would help me escape all this death and despair," and this daemon I'm talking with, "I have to go."</p>

<p>"Where?" she asked</p>

<p>"To a sheriff in…" should I tell it? The road proved to be dangerous, I hated to admit it but I might need her help, "in a town called Valentine."</p>

<p>"Valentine?" she exhaled, "I know where that is, we go to Valentine." and began walking past me.</p>

<p>I blinked in disbelief and followed her shortly. I wasn’t expecting her to know her way to Valentine, reaching that town is now made—somewhat—easier with this horrid beast by my side. But what about the money… That's still an issue, and robbing folk with this thing might end up ugly. I don't want my future victims to meet the same fate as the mercenaries…</p>

<p>The mercenaries had it coming, but it could've have been different, could've been less gruesome, there's a proper way to kill a man, as absurd as it may sound, a bullet is cleaner and instant—</p>

<p>"Wait!" I cried, she looked at me weird, "I uhh… have to check something first, it won't take long." I ran back to the duo I shot earlier, those mercenaries must have money on them. I wasn't sure if she was following because I didn't hear any footsteps. I looked behind me, and she was there, creeping like a stalking predator despite its enormous size, she was as slight as the night. Looting the other mercenaries, the ones she killed would be unwise, their money—or valuables—would be stained in blood, raising many questions of their origins.<br />
 <br />
We arrived at the two dead men and their dog, still laying where I left them, crows seized the opportunity to feast on the fresh corpses, standing on their faces and picking their eyes out. They flew away the second they sensed our presence. I went first for the old man, while she stood next to the shotgunner. </p>

<p>His outer pocket had some cigars and matches, and as I hopped, his inner pocket contained some money and other valuables. Twenty dollars to be exact, a silver watch and a liquor flask, it seemed to be full, thank God. I stashed all the loot in my pockets and went to check the shotgunner.</p>

<p>I tried to ignore his eyeless body—and the beast next to me—while I robbed him, he wouldn't miss it. I justified it to myself, avoiding his disfigured face. His outer pockets had twenty five dollars and a quarter. Not bad, I think I might have enough money, but it was less than I was promised from the hunt.</p>

<p>I slid my hand in his inner pocket and my face turned pale, immediately recoiling my hand as soon as I touched it, it was a piece of paper, and a… ring… I felt sick to my core, I didn't dare stealing that ring or open the letter.</p>

<p>"Something wrong?" she asked?</p>

<p>"No, no nothing," I answered, opening the flask and drinking half the liquor in one swig. It was whisky. It's been a while since I got my last fix, bad memories came flooding in, I need to go back, I need to find her. But… would she forgive if she ever knew? If she knew how many I have killed and robbed? I looked at the shotgunner in melancholy, his girl was waiting for him, and I denied her her wishes…</p>

<p>I fell on my knees next to the eyeless shotgunner and began digging with my bare hands, "What are you doing?" she asked, but I didn't reply. The soil was harsh on my skin but that didn't stop me, before long she began imitating me and digging as well, her pace was quicker and more effective than mine.</p>

<p>After I—we were done digging, I dragged the shotgunner by the arms and placed him in the shallow grave. She saw what I did and went to do the same with the old man, picking him up and throwing his corpse next to the young man.</p>

<p>I removed their bandanas, I couldn't stomach seeing the young man's disfigured face, I couldn't bear it, I covered their faces first, to lessen the guilt.</p>

<p>Collecting four straightish sticks, I tied them with the bandanas making two crosses, planting both crosses on the shared grave.</p>

<p>"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, we are nothing but dust and to dust shall we return, amen." I prayed, "and I'm sorry." murmured to myself.</p>

<p>"Amen" she said softly, I wasn't sure if she did it on her own volition or was simply mimicking me. I sighed.</p>

<p>I wasn't the religious type, far from it, but figured that what he—and she— would've wanted, to get a proper burial and a marked grave. In a way, I was thankful that they were killed by my hand, rather than that thing standing next to me…</p>

<p>I wasn't sure if I felt safe around her, she's a wild animal, and I saw what she's able to do, what would stop her from going feral on me, what would stop her? She had an unusual affinity towards me for some reason.</p>

<p>That nightmare of Lillian didn’t leave my mind, I would ruin myself a thousand times if it meant seeing her one last time. But would she still love a rotten dog?</p>

<p>I picked my broken rifle and we were on our way to Valentine.</p>

===CHAPTER5===
<p>It was late afternoon, I have been following this creature for the remainder of the day, we've been walking non-stop for hours. The shotgun hung on my back by the strap and she carried the rifle, it became somewhat unwieldy to carry it around all the time. I wasn't sure where we were going but I was sure it wasn't to the waterfall. The monster seemed to know where she's going as we ventured deeper in the woods and further away from the slaughter. At least on the bright side—If I could even call it that—if the mercenaries were found, they'd most likely suspect it was the doing of a monster and not me.</p>

<p>We haven't said a word to one another during our brief time together, I didn't know if it was fear or disdain for the thing guiding me through the woods, perhaps it was both. And she wasn't the talkative type anyway, too focused on the task at hand, occasionally stopping to smell the air or whenever she heard a sound. Her behavior and appearance was of an apex predator, and she probably is.</p>

<p>How many people has she killed so far? And how long till it's my turn? Avoiding future enemies should be our priority, not fearing for my life, but for theirs too.</p>

<p>Her pace quickened, dashing between trees, "Wait for me!" I shouted, Goddamn it. She disappeared behind the trees. I ran behind her not wanting to lose the only thing crucial to my survival in this cursed woods.</p>

<p>We found ourselves out of the woods at the outskirts of a corn field, it was big with withered crops, extending as far as the eye could see, the only thing of notice was a lonely scarecrow in the middle of the field and a two story farm house residing at the end of the field with a barn and a well next to it.</p>

<p>"Getting dark, dangerous, we sleep in the house." she said</p>

<p>"Beat me to it." I replied, sleeping under a roof beats the open. I would kill to sleep on a real bed away from whatever lurks in the shadows. We made our way to the house through the field and stopped by the scarecrow, it was apparent it wasn't just a bunch of stuffed clothes imitating the human form, but a crucified corpse hung lazily on the cross with its arms and legs tied to it, and its face was covered with a sake torn from old age—or from bird trying to feast on his flesh—revealing an eye that wasn't quite human, all red and no humanity left in it. He was wearing a dark coat, bloody white shirt and dirty pants. A sign was hanging from his neck, with a message written on it. Was this man crucified before or after losing his mind? Whoever he was, he didn't appear to be like the farmer type judging from his clothes. Perhaps he wondered here and the folk put him as a warning, or as an example.</p>

<p>"Beware travelers, this house offers you neither rest nor safety, leave while you can, and don't be as stubborn as we were, it brought us nothing but death and misery." I read it out loud, "Huh, You reckon we should take this warning?" I asked the beast next to me. She didn't seem to care about it and went straight to the house, so I followed. Whatever evil lies there won't stand a chance against her, I told myself.</p>

<p>The house was old, perhaps built before the war, it had a yellowish white tint to it that was peeling away, revealing the dark molded wood underneath, giving away its old age and abandonment. Some of its windows were smashed and the main door sealed with wooden boards, "LEAVE" was hastily written on it with big bold letters. Near the house was an equally old well with its cover still on and a bucket sitting on it, and not far away from it, a barn that was somehow in a worse state than the house, it seems it's about to collapse any moment now. It wasn't that big, crops seemed to be the main output of this farm.</p>

<p>"You're thirsty?" I asked, all this walking dried my mouth and my canteen was empty.</p>

<p>"Yes." She answered dryly. I think the last time I saw her drink was two nights ago. I removed the well's cover and threw the bucket, it was a bit deeper than what I anticipated but it wasn’t long before it hit the water level and I began pulling. She stood on all four next to me, staring at my soul with her sinister skull, I'll never get used to this.</p>

<p>As I pulled the bucket, I was half expecting to pull something horrible out of the or for the water to be polluted. Surprisingly it was clean—or looked clean.</p>

<p>It had no bad smell and looked clear. I filled my canteen and gave my companion the water. With her boney maw facing the sky and wide open, she instantly downed it all in one breath and threw the bucket on the ground. I didn't drink mine right away, instead I mixed it with the whisky I had, giving it some time to probably sit in before drinking.</p>

<p>Before going to the house, I told her we had to check the barn first, not for animals, but to make sure there weren't any undeads—or monsters—that might bother us during the night.</p>

<p>The barn appeared to be older than the house and in dire need of fixing. A big hole in the roof, wood rotting away and barely holding together, it would probably collapse if she breathed on it. The gate was sealed with a wooden board. I removed it and had the shotgun at the ready, slowly opening the gate, and we were welcomed with the horrible stench of death and swarms of flies.</p>

<p>After the flies cleared off, I saw a handful of animals—if you can call them that—laying motionless on the floor. It was dark in there which made it hard to identify them but they seemed like cows and horses. Cows and horses with human faces… Nope. I closed the barn and sealed it again. "Let's check the house." I told my companion, she didn’t say a word and followed me. I didn't want to see anymore freakshows, the one I had is already more than enough for me. The things in the barn seemed quite dead anyway from how rotten and scrawny their corpses looked. They won't bother us during the night. I hoped.</p>

<p>The front door was haphazardly nailed with wooden boards, it seems the previous residents wanted to keep outsiders from entering—or keep whatever inside the house from coming out. The beast grabbed the wooden barricades and yanked them like they were nothing. "Wait!" She was about to smash the door. "It might not be locked." She stopped and looked at me.</p>

<p>I twisted the knob and with a click, the door was open, "After you." I said waving my hand, she huffed and entered, I followed with the shotgun. The door was rather small for her but she managed to squeeze in, having a beast larger than a horse made the house feel smaller than it was.</p>

<p>The house was empty and in a deplorable state, everything covered in thick layers of dust and cobwebs infesting every corner, bookshelves thrown with books scattered everywhere, on the furniture, the floor and the stairway.</p>

<p>I opened the first door I saw and it was the kitchen, covered in dust and in a messy condition as well, an old stove next to the smashed window and two tall cabinets next to it, kitchenware scattered across the dirty floor. Plates and glasses smashed, table flipped over and broken chairs. The back door was busted, barely holding together with the broken hinges. Whatever was here had already escaped.</p>

<p>"Is anyone here?" I shouted, shotgun in hand, and as expected, no one responded. "Do you smell anything?" I asked the beast.</p>

<p>She sniffed the air and shook her head, confirming my suspicion. I lowered the shotgun in relief. She threw the rifle on the wooden floor and turned around to leave the kitchen</p>

<p>"Where are you goin'?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To hunt, to bring food." She replied. Despite the clearance of the house, I didn't like being left alone. The house felt like it would devour me alive the second I was alone.</p>

<p>"Don't stray away, OK?" I told her. But she didn't reply and just left, and I was alone again.</p>

<p>I sighed to myself and went to the table, flipping it back on its feet, I picked the rifle and placed it on the table alongside the shotgun. She'll come back with some food, I need to prepare a fire for the stove.</p>

<p>I took my canteen, the whisky had enough time to set in. As I tilted my face upward and drank, I noticed how my face wasn't hurting anymore, touching the bandages and the pain was completely gone, huh, this sort of wound tends to take weeks to heal… Was it because of that drug I drank earlier? I untied the bandages and the wound wasn't bleeding, looking at my reflection in the broken window and the wound had completely healed, leaving a scar as a reminder of what this thing did to me. </p>

<p>I've changed a lot. Sometimes I don't know who I am anymore.</p>

<p>I sighed and left my reflection, I need firewood not contemplating my life. I walked out of the broken door and found myself in the backyard, it was spacious with a couple of apple trees in it, behind them the woods resided, the thick tree line could be hiding both man and beast. At least one of them isn't actively trying to kill me.</p>

<p>Under the apple tree's shade, an axe was planted in a log alongside a pile of fire wood waiting to be chopped. I got hold of the grip and yanked it out. Placing a piece of fire wood and raising the heavy blade high in the sky, I struck the wood but it didn't split as the axe was a bit dull. Placing my foot on the wood I yanked the blade and held it high again, this time I stuck it with greater force, and the wood gave and split in half.</p>

<p>I struck the halves to quarters, I took another piece of wood and did the same, now with eight pieces it would be enough to make a good fire. I planted the axe back in the log and gathered some twigs as fire starters. When I was done, I noticed two crows watching me from their nest up on the roof, sitting next to each other enjoying the show. It reminded me of how lonely I was. I haven't met a single soul to share my sorrow with, everyone I ran across tried to either kill me or cash on my reward. Well, except for her.</p>

<p>I Spent most of my years drifting alone, robbing stagecoaches and other lonely travelers for a living. I considered running with a gang at one point, but that wasn't my style, I was better than that.</p>

<p>Being alone after having company was weird, like I have to get used to it again. Although her company was unwanted, it was reassuring to some degree, to know someone got my back and cares about me—What the hell am I saying, get a hold of yourself. Am I this starved for human connection to the point I'm now seeking the company of a monster? I better not get too attached to this thing, soon I'll come back to civilization and find Lillian and all of this monsters and outlaws stuff would be in the past, where they belong. </p>

<p>But what's her deal anyway? Was this her home? Is that why she knew her way to it? Maybe that's why she took a liking to me, perhaps I reminded her of someone she once knew. Her brother, father, son or maybe… her husband… does she think she's married to me?</p>

<p>I pushed these thoughts aside, it doesn't matter what she views me as, I'm not staying with her for long. I went back to the kitchen and threw the wood inside the stove, then went to check the cabinets. They might have some canned food, or what I was looking for, some coffee—although it would probably taste awful.</p>

<p>The cabinet had an array of canned food, beans, carrots, corn, and tomatoes. But my hopes were immediately shattered, "Production date: 1862" were plastered on all of them. These things are beyond expired, I didn't bother opening the cans and closed the cabinet. I checked the next one, and as soon as I opened it a wide grin drew on my face. I was greeted with jars labeled sugar, tea, salt and coffee, also—somewhat—clean cups among other less important things such as spoiled spices and rotten pickle jars.</p>

<p>My smile quickly disappeared the moment I opened the coffee jar, it was empty. Of course it would be empty. Well, I guess tea it is. I checked the tea—and thankfully—it was half full, I suppose the folks of this house were more of the coffee type. The salt however had only a spoonful remaining while the sugar had a quarter left. It would be enough to cook the meat and make sweet tea.</p>

<p>I went outside to bring some water, she still hadn't returned yet. Threw the bucket in the well and pulled it. Back in the kitchen with a full bucket, I took the dirty kettle from the ground and washed it before filling it with water, I placed it on the stove and took a match from my pocket and a cigar as well, striking the match, the stove was already ablaze, I lit my cigar with the fire too. Huffing on the cigar, I throw some tea leaves and sugar in the kettle, it will probably taste like sugary water with a hint of tea scent.</p>

<p>With nothing left to do in the kitchen I left to explore the house, trying to discover who lived here would be a good way to kill time until tea starts boiling and she returns with dinner. </p>

<p>Puffing on the cigar, first I checked the living room, nothing really out of the ordinary, bookshelves laying on the ground, scattered books, some smashed vases and a long couch and a couple of armchairs, a coffee table in front of them, all covered in a thick layer of dust. The couches were facing the big windows, overlooking the fields. In its heyday it would have been a great and prideful sight for the folks you used to live here, but now, all it did was bring depression upon the soul. Sad barn about to fall down, withered crops and an ominous scarecrow.</p>

<p>Perhaps upstairs and the bedrooms might have some answers, or for the very least, something my size to replace this bloody gray coat with. As I ascended the stairs, I couldn't help but notice the lack of any pictures or portraits in the house, usually those big houses would have dozens hanging on the walls. It seems they took them all with them when they left. Well here goes unraveling this house's mystery—and hers as well.</p>

<p>The second floor had three bedrooms, the two doors nearest to me were opened ajar while the furthest one was closed. I went to the first room to my right.</p>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary, a bed with messy sheets in the middle, a writing table next to the wall and a closet next to it, windows were open blowing the curtains. They were facing the field, a good room to sleep in. We could see anyone approaching from here. I walked to the closet and opened it, hoping to find something to replace this coat with, and to my disappointment, it was empty.</p>

<p>I left the room and went to the second one, it looked similar to the first, and the closet was wide open revealing that it was empty, saving me the effort of opening it. I sighed in disappointment and left. </p>

<p>Back in the hallway, one room left, the closed room. It stood there, something about it felt off, like something—or someone—was hiding behind it. I could feel it.</p>

<p>It struck me as a bit odd that this was the only closed door of the bunch. I went to open it and the wooden floor creaked with each step I took. It made me feel like an intruder despite fully knowing the house was empty. It added to my dread, the nonexistent dread, I shouldn't be here. Despite my irrational fear, I placed my hand on the knob, and before I could twist it I heard a thud coming from outside the house. "Connor!" A wolfish voice called. I let go of the knob and went downstairs.</p>

<p>She's back with our dinner. It calmed my nerves that I wasn't alone anymore, perhaps that's why I dreaded opening that door. Part of me wanted to see what lies behind it, to prove there's nothing and it was mere paranoia, but another didn't want to be proven wrong. No, I'm just being paranoid.</p>

<p>When I got outside I found her standing next to the dead buck she just brought, like a hunting dog proud of her catch. The buck, however, was missing its head.</p>

<p>“Your blood stopped.” She remarked upon seeing me.</p>

<p>“Yeah, thanks to that drug you forced me to drink" I replied, "Did you know about it?”</p>

<p>“No.” she exhaled. Of course.</p>

<p>I knelt to take my share of the buck, but something was off about it, its legs looked wrong, they were longer and the hooves had extra toes, they looked like crooked human toes… I looked at the barn and remembered the animal-things I saw there. Did she intentionally remove the head after she saw my disgust earlier?</p>

<p>"Thanks for bringing dinner." I didn't want to think about it, I didn't want to even eat it, but food is scarce and I'm hungry.</p>

<p>She looked at me weird, it was hard to tell from the emotionless and expressionless skull, was she studying my expression? Or did she forget how to respond? </p>

<p>"You're supposed to say you're welcome."</p>

<p>"You're welcome." she finally exhaled.</p>

<p>I took my chunk of meat and went inside. The tea was already boiling so I removed the kettle and took a cup from the cabinet, cleaned it before pouring some tea. I took a sip, and as expected, the sugary water barely had any tea flavor in it.</p>

<p>Better than nothing I suppose. We used to start and end our days with a cup of sweet tea, it became a sort of a tradition to us. We would take turns visiting one another to eat breakfast together. When it was my turn, it would be eggs, scrambled or boiled, I preferred them scrambled while she liked them boiled. We had some chicken so we had eggs everyday. And when it was her turn we would eat corn bread, they weren't sweet but the tea balanced it out. Cornbread and tea was her favorite breakfast combination. I would've made some just for the sake of it but there's practically nothing in this kitchen.</p>

<p>I took a cast iron pan from the floor and cleaned it too. Placing it on the stove, I trimmed some of the fat from the meat and threw it in the pan, there was nothing to cook with in this miserable kitchen. Just a pinch of salt and buck-thing meat.</p>

<p>The fat began sizzling and the air was filled with the smell of rendered fat, it smelled fairly normal, I hope it tastes normal too.</p>

<p>I cut the meat into small chunks and throw it in the pan alongside the salt, stirring them so they would mix properly. While waiting for it to cook, I returned to my tea.</p>

<p>While smoking and drinking tea, I remembered this native man I once met, forgot from which tribe he was, but they had a legend about cannibals who went mad from the taste of human blood and flesh, eating a man's flesh to steal his strength, the more they indulged with this ravenous desires the more they craved, or something among those lines. I looked at my meal, I think I'll overcook it slightly. Does it count as cannibalism? The thing was barely human, and would cooking it even remove the cannibalism from it? I shouldn't let mere legends frighten me.</p>

<p>The meat seemed to be done, it had a nice sear to it and looked like regular buck meat, but I left them for an extra minute, just to be safe. </p>

<p>I threw the cigar in the fire and took the pan off the heat, it was about to get burned at this point. Placing the pan on the table, picked a fork from the ground and cleaned it like the rest. I ate from the pan, not bothering with a plate. The meat tasted normal, kind of tasty too, although a bit overcooked and chewy, but that was intentional on my part. Meat is one of the few foods that is hard to ruin unless you burn it. A pinch of pepper was missing but tasted good nonetheless.</p>

<p>While I ate I observed my companion through the window demolishing the buck-thing with no regard for mannerism—if she still remembers them.</p>

<p>I wonder if she's the creature of legends, she ate human flesh before, but I don't remember him mentioning anything about transforming into a monster with a skull for its head. It doesn't matter, she's real and not the work of legends.</p>

<p>Who is—was she? This question still bothers me. While contemplating the ravenous beast outside, I noticed the wounds once again. I felt bad for the thing, she saved me twice, guided me, and brought me food, while I did nothing to repay her favors.</p>

<p>I quickly wolfed the meat and went to search the house once again, surgical tools must be hiding somewhere, but it was all in vain, they must've taken with them when they left, of course they would. I sighed and took the extra sheets from the other rooms and went back to the kitchen, I guess I'll have to extract them with my knife. I quickly cleaned the knife before checking on her, the last thing I want is for her to die from infection.</p>

<p>I went outside and found her still cleaning what little flesh remained on the carcass, licking her blooded claws and muzzle. "Hey…" I said to grab her attention, I didn't know what to call her.</p>

<p>She looked at me still covered in blood and chunks of meat sticking between her fangs, and I just noticed she had deep blue eyes. The night of the hunt and dim lightning of the cave made them hard to notice, it was already hard to see her eyes from that skull of hers.</p>

<p>"Let me see your wounds" I said, placing the bucket and sheets on the ground.</p>

<p>She looked at her wounds then at me, "Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To remove the bullets so they won't get infected," I answered, "So you won't get sick."</p>

<p>She looked at me for a moment like she was thinking of something, and sat next to the carcass, or what was left of it.</p>

<p>I got closer to inspect the wounds on her arm first, two bullet wounds of different sizes, it looks like a rifle and a pistol round. The wounds were already healing and began to close, it's weird, it hasn't been a full day since her injury. And just occurred to me, she wasn't limping anymore, in fact, her leg didn't look injured in any way. Her healing was terrifyingly fast, that would explain how she resisted those sleeping bullets.</p>

<p>I rolled my sleeves and pulled the knife, "Could you lie on the ground? It would be easier that way." and she did, she looked like a dog, an oversized monster dog, "This might hurt a bit," it didn't seem to bother her when she got shot, so I doubt a knife would, but the heads-up was necessary. </p>

<p>I began digging the smaller bullet first, the dark blood oozed on the blade and my hands, pulling it was easier than I expected, the deformed bullet seemed to be a .45 colt. It didn't penetrate deep enough to reach the bone, it was mostly surface level. "Did it hurt?" she didn't respond. One is done and four to go. I stabbed the knife into the larger wound, it proved more difficult than the colt round as it was deeper, but not deep enough to hit the bone.</p>

<p>After I was finished with her arm I went to check the wounds on her chest, lifting the fur and I was greeted with her breasts… I ignored them and—Jesus! A slug planting itself deep in her chest bone, the wound was larger and nastier the rest, did they shoot her point blank? Her bones must be made of steel if she could withstand this type of caliber. The two other wounds were closer to her abdomen, they were less severe but still deep, two rifle shots from the look of it.</p>

<p>I aimed the tip of the knife and tried extracting the rifle rounds first, which proved more changeling from the first two. I could feel her breathing become heavier with each stroke of the knife, and mine as well. I pulled the first and the second bullet, they looked like Krag rounds. The slug was the last one remaining, and it looked more painful and difficult to extract. Planting itself firmly in her chest bone, and the bone had already healed around it, almost sealing it inside her skeleton. I took a deep breath and started digging.</p>

<p>The thing wasn't getting out, damn it, "I have to dig in the bone to remove it, I would be lyin' if I said this would only hurt a bit." She didn't respond. I cut around the flesh wound to make it easier for me to reach the slug, I could feel her chest rising and falling with each heavy breath. I began digging and carving the bone, I could hear her faintly whimpering and shaking each stroke and bit of the bone removed.</p>

<p>I wanted to give her some of that drug to dull the pain but I better save it for myself. I doubt a small bottle would have an effect on a creature of her size anyway.</p>

<p>After I removed enough of the bone, the slug finally loosened enough and was moving freely.</p>

<p>Digging the knife underneath the slug, I lifted it and snatched it with my other hand. The slug was bigger and heavier than I expected, a ten gauge round it seemed to be. I don't want to be on the receiving end of this thing, those mercenaries were meaning business.</p>

<p>She was about to stand up but I stopped her, "We're not done yet," she cocked her head at me, "I need to cauterize the wounds and stop the bleedin' and possible infection." She complied and laid on her back again. I took a few bullets from my pocket and removed the tip with my knife, they were slippery from the dark blood on both of my hands and the knife. Moving her fur away from the wound, I poured the powder on the wounds on her arm first, "This is gonna sting.'" I took a deep breath and struck a match. I was probably more nervous than her. </p>

<p>The flashing flame vanished as soon as it appeared, and she let out a shriek with it. The smell of smoke, burnt flesh and fur filled the air. I did the same for the remaining wounds, shrieking each time I lit the powder. When I was done with the cauterizing, I tore the sheets, covered her burnt flesh. Her breathing gradually returned to normal, "How does it feel?" I asked. </p>

<p>"It hurt." she exhaled in the wolf's voice, and took a long pause "Thanks." the woman's voice said.</p>

<p>I blinked, almost forgetting how to respond, "You're welcome."</p>

<p>Washing my hands and knife from the dark blood after this successful operation, the sun began to sleep and I was now ready to head back in and rest after this long and exhausting day.</p>

<p>She stood up and followed me to the house, I went to the kitchen first to get the rifle and shotgun then headed to the stairs. I didn't feel her behind me so I looked back and she was still in the kitchen, staring at the kettle. "Want some tea?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Tea?" she murmured before snatching the kettle and downing it all in one breath. "Sweet, taste good." she licked her maw.</p>

<p>"Huh, you like it sweet too?" I said, nodding her head in response. </p>

<p>We climbed the stairs and the wooden floor creaked under her weight. It felt like it would break any moment, but didn't. We went to the room with the windows facing the field, it had a better view to see anyone that might be coming. Leaning the guns against the nightstand, I sat on the bed, while she laid on the floor. She seemed a bit disappointed that she couldn't sleep with me, as the bed was too small for her—and I didn't want to experience the awkwardness of last night.</p>

<p>I unbuckled the gun belt and took off the poncho and the bandolier. I took my boots off and then collapsed on the bed. Finally, a rest well earned on a real bed under a real roof. I didn't give a damn about that warning, this bed alone is worth the risk, and beside that, I have my own personal beast for self defense, and speaking of which.</p>

<p>"You're comfortable on the floor?" I asked, looking at her from the bed. I can't lie that I was getting a bit curious about her, what is her deal exactly?</p>

<p>"Like the cave, but warmer." she replied.</p>

<p>"I was wonderin'—who are you… or was you…?" She raised her head and looked at me. I couldn't tell what she was thinking but I felt like I offended her in some way or another. "If you don't mind me askin' obviously"</p>

<p>"I can't remember." She said with a sad voice.</p>

<p>Can't? "You used to live in this house?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Do… you know the people who lived here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"During that night, Why did you save?" the question that really bothered me. "Did I… remind you of someone you once knew?"</p>

<p>She looked at me trying to think of an answer, but shook her head in defeat. "I don't know"</p>

<p>I sighed, Why did I expect she would have any answers. "well, I suppose it's only fair if you get your turn with the questionin'"</p>

<p>She looked at me thinking again, shadows covering her eyes, only the emotionless expressionless skull stared at me, "Those people, that night and this morning, Who were they?"</p>

<p>"They were hunters and I was assigned with them to… well, hunt you." It felt weird saying that in her face. "They promised me freedom in exchange for this job, but they had other plans, and ironically enough, you woke up and saved me. And for those earlier that day, they were mercenaries, most likely hired by Baker to track and hunt me down."<br />
<br />
"Why are you going to Valentine?"</p>

<p>"I told you, I'm meeting with a sheriff that would help me escape."</p>

<p>She didn't seem satisfied with my answer.</p>

<p>"And I want to meet this girl… but I don't know if she still remembers me." I sighed, I hope she still thinks of me like I think of her.</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Lillian." I said sheepishly </p>

<p>"Do you fear me?” She asked in the woman's voice, it was softer than before.</p>

<p>The question caught me off guard, she must've sensed my uneasiness towards her during our brief time together. In a way I did, she's a creature of nightmares, but on the other hand, she saved my life twice already and helped me in my journey.</p>

<p>"No, I don't fear you." I lied</p>

<p>She lowered her head and slept like a dog. I don't know whether she believed me or not.</p>

<p>"Good night" I said to her but she didn't reply.</p>

<p>I laid on the bed and closed my eyes, trying to ignore the thing sleeping in the same room as me.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>I wake up from a dream I couldn't quite remember to the sounds of a woman's weeping. The sun wasn't out yet, only the dim blue hue of twilight cascading through the window illuminating the room.</p>

<p>At first I thought the cries were just a dream, but it continued. I looked at the monster in my room, expecting her to be the source of it, but she was still sleeping, the sounds were coming from outside the room. I stood up and took the navy from the nightstand and went to investigate the weeping woman. Carefully walking with each step not to make any unnecessary noises, I left the room without startling the beast.</p>

<p>The doors and everything in the hallway were as I left them, except for one, the closed door was open, and the weeping was coming from it. It can't be, she said no one was here. Did the woman come while we were sleeping?</p>

<p>"Miss?" I called, but weeping was her only response. "Miss? It's OK, I won't hurt you." I said as I walked to the door, gun in hand, something was wrong in her voice, it might be a monster that mimics humans for all I know.</p>

<p>The wooden floor creaked behind me, I turned and saw the beast's head sticking out of our room's door. "Someone is here, don't get closer, I don't want to scare her." I whispered to her and she stayed there.</p>

<p>As I opened the door I saw who was making the noise, a woman with her back facing me, wearing tattered clothes and crying, "Miss? It's alright." I called again. She was on her knees crying and sobbing on a pile of clothes with shattered frames scattered around. Was she the lady of the house? I lowered my gun, not wanting to threaten or scare the poor lady.</p>

<p>"Sorry for trespassing Miss, but we—I thought this house was abandoned, I mean you no harm and I will leave immediately." the room's windows were facing westward, it was darker than our room, I couldn't see the poor girl probably.</p>

<p>"Miss…" It felt wrong to leave her in this state without doing something, I got closer, entering the room. "Are you alright—" my advancing came to an abrupt stop as I noticed her knife-like claws. Without hesitation I cocked the hammer and raised the gun at the thing in front of me, whatever it is, it's no longer human. Aiming the gun at its head, I was about to pull the trigger but a wolfish whisper stopped me.</p>

<p>"Don't" I looked behind me and the beast was at the door, hunched and on all four to show her head. "Leave her be."</p>

<p>I looked at the weeping woman, still hadn't noticed our intrusion. I felt bad for the lady, killing it was putting it out of its misery, death itself was an act of kindness. But the way she said it, it seemed like a warning, as if horrible things would follow if I pulled the trigger. Carefully, I decocked the hammer and retreaded from the ominous room, I was about to close the door but opted not to. My guts told me to listen to her.</p>

<p>The floor creaked under my heels on the way back to our room, each step sounded like it would alert the monster in the next room. She stayed in the hallway while I went to get my stuff. It was time to leave this place. I sat on the bed and wore my boots, buckling my gun pelt and holsters, I glimpsed through the window and saw a band of riders in the field, this time they were army colors. Shit! Hastily I snatched what remained of my gear and bolted out of the room.</p>

<p>"We’re leaving now!" I told my creature, "From the kitchen's door, there's riders coming from the front door!" I raced down stairs and she followed, I could still hear the faint cries as we left from the backdoor.</p>

<p>The backyard was closer to the woods and in no time the thick trees concealed us, we ran as far as we could. </p>

<p>"Back in the house," I finally said after making a considerable distance from the haunted house, grasping for air between each word, "You saw the riders? That's why you didn't want me to shoot it?"</p>

<p>"No." She answered bluntly. "It hurts, it hurts to remember."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"She remembers who she was, it drives the soul mad."</p>

<p>It hurts to remember? "But you said you can't remember… is that why you’re not <em> mad </em>?" mad wasn't the word to describe this creature. Animalistic or savage perhaps, but she wasn't insane.</p>

<p>"I don’t know," She replied, "But she won't attack unless provoked," She paused for a bit, "and I would not be able to protect you from it."</p>

<p>"I see…" The last bit ran chills down my spine.</p>

<p>Panicked gun fire, terrified men screaming and a horrifying howl in the distance cut my line of thought.</p>

<p>I was thankful I didn't go through with that shot.</p>

===CHAPTER6===
<p>The sun was hot, rough rope around my neck, it felt like thorns. My hands tied behind my back and itching from the ropes, they made sure they were uncomfortable and tight. The gallows were built hastily, judging by how flimsy the platform I stood on was, it seemed like it would give under my weight alone, but it didn't. Despite the scorching sun, the air was unnaturally cold.</p>

<p>A faceless crowd with nothing better to do than to watch me hang. An ugly priest stood in front of me, his bald sweat-covered head reflecting the blinding sun rays directly in my eyes, giving his generic speech about our lord that I didn't care about, nor the crowd did. They only cared to see a man die, that's why they gathered today.</p>

<p>He kept coughing violently between each word, barely holding it together, it seemed like he would die before me.</p>

<p>While the sheriff—one that I haven't seen before—a scrawny and tall man with a big and unkempt mustache, the color of his old dark coat and hat was turning into a dark shade of gray from how worn they were.</p>

<p>He was leaning against one of the gallows posts across of me, bored and uncaring about the hanging. He had seen this a thousand times before, perhaps more. I couldn't blame him, the priest was barely intelligible and the sun was extraordinarily hot and the air was unusually cold. Instead of canceling each other out, it made it even more unbearable.</p>

<p>We both knew how it would end, the priest and his speech were there just as a formality, there was no need to delay the inevitable, the crowd would've preferred its exclusion, at least that's how the sheriff and I felt.</p>

<p>"I think that's enough for the day," The sheriff interrupted the priest as he wasn't able to continue, "Go and get some rest."</p>

<p>"No no no I still got it in me, I didn't even reach the best part yet." he said pointing at the piece of paper in his hand, before letting out a big cough, strong enough to almost fall off the gallows. The sheriff didn't reply, instead opting only for a tired stare.</p>

<p>"Well, if you insist, you'll find me in the saloon if you wanna see me and drink. You know, after this is done." he said before giving me a pitied look and murmured, "May the lord have mercy on your soul." and descended the stairs, on the way down he had another coughing fit and almost fell.</p>

<p>The sheriff took a piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it. "Today we came here to witness—why do I even bother, you've already heard this a thousand times before." he said it with a bored voice. He wanted to get it done and be on his way. I sighed, I suppose I'm not worthy of a proper hanging. </p>

<p>"Murder of a commissioned officer, treason against the states, desertion, slaughter of his fellow soldiers, armed robbery, manslaughter and disturbin' of the peace wherever he lay foot." I didn't reply to any of his accusations because they were all true, hearing my crimes back to back filled me with great shame and made me hate myself even more. I wished he would just pull that lever and be done with it. "Cannibalism and betrayin' his fellow man—"</p>

<p>"CANNIBALISM?! BETRAYIN' MY FELLOW MAN?!" I shouted, "THE HELL ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT!? I NEVER COMMITTED SUCH CRIMES!" I yelled at him.</p>

<p>"—and most importantly, breakin' his promise." he said nonchalantly before putting that piece of paper back in his pocket.</p>

<p>"WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? WHAT PROMISE?? I DIDN'T BREAK ANY PROMISES!?!?" even more accusations I didn't dare to think of committing.</p>

<p>The crowd cursed my name, calling me a liar, unfaithful and that I didn't have a soul, how could a man who took the company of daemons could ever have a soul.</p>

<p>"THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU! ACCUSIN' ME OF CRIMES I NEVER DID! I KILLED AND ROBBED, BUT THIS?! I NEVER ATE A MAN'S FLESH NOR BETRAYED HUMANITY—GET THIS THING OFF ME!" The sheriff put the hood on my head. I couldn't see a damn thing in it, I struggled, trying to free my hands from the tight restraints, but it was all in vain.</p>

<p>"I NEVER BROKE MY PROMISE! I WAS ON MY WAY TO HER BEFORE I ENDED UP HERE! RELEASE ME NOW! BEFORE I KILL YOU!—BEFORE SHE KILLS YOU ALL! WITHOUT ME TO STOP HER SHE WILL HAUNT YOU TO THE REST OF YOUR MISRABLE DAYS! IT WON'T LEAVE ANY ONE OF YOU ALIVE! YOU HEAR!"</p>

<p>The crowd got louder, cursing my name, telling me to go to hell and yelling at the lawman to pull the lever already, "TO HELL WITH YOU ALL I—" A short drop and a sudden stop shut me down.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>I woke up gasping for air, it felt like my neck snapped for real.</p>

<p>I saw my beast stretching like a dog in the same spot she slept in the night before, her animalistic features made her look cute—and grotesque—in her own unique way. </p>

<p>"You are awake." she exhaled, locking her skull at me, "Something wrong?" The woman's voice has been more dominant as of late. It still felt a bit off as there was an eerie hint of the wolf's in it. It was hard getting used to it, especially as she got more talkative since we left that house.</p>

<p>"I'm fine, just a bad dream." I said scratching my neck, I had a strong headache and it was hard to breathe. A cigar would've helped with the headache but I've already smoked them all. </p>

<p>This the second time I dreamt of being hanged, it's that or being mauled to death by savage beasts. This was our fourth night in the wild, and I still don't feel safe around her. I kept my distance from her each night we slept. That night in the cave rubbed me the wrong way.</p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes, I didn't know why I kept dreaming of being hanged, the firing squad is what awaits me when they finally get me, not the gallows.</p>

<p>"We still have a long road ahead of us, we better get started." I stood up and wore my gear. We've left the deeper parts of the woods, but we still haven't seen any signs of civilization yet. We haven't encountered any undeads or anything weird since we left the house a couple days ago. And I intend to keep it that way.</p>

<p>I slung the shotgun on my back and wore my hat, "Would you carry this for me?" I gave her the broken rifle and satchel, since we're stuck together I figured I might as well let her carry some of the weight of me.</p>

<p>She took my gear, I removed her bandages the day before, they healed extremely quickly, it was almost like she was never shot before, only light scars on her body were left as an evidence of what had happened. She probably didn't need the cauterizing nor the bandages but I felt compelled to do it anyway.</p>

<p>"You are tired." she said softly.</p>

<p>"I'm fine, The faster we get back the better." She was right. We've been walking nonstop for four days. We've crossed a great distance but at the cost of my body. I could barely stand and we haven't eaten in two nights, she couldn't find anything to hunt. It seemed like all animals just disappeared to thin air—save for a handful of birds watching us from their nests. They were too far to shoot and too small to bother with. </p>

<p>I imagined hunger would bother her more than me since she's the bigger one, but she hasn't complained or shown any signs of slowing down.</p>

<p>I coughed, which only amplified my headache. These nightmares only made each night more challenging when it comes to sleep, the cold starting to become unbearable and there's this weird feeling being watched all the time. I wasn't sure whether she was the one watching me in my sleep or if there's something lurking in the woods that was stalking us. If we had a stalker she would probably have caught their scent a long time ago. I'm just being paranoid for no real reason.</p>

<p>I'm sick of this, I'm sick of this life, I'm sick of people trying to kill me, sick of unholy abominations, sick of this beast and sick of everything. I'm so close to returning to my old life, this nightmare will end soon.</p>

<p>The cold breeze helped me stay awake, the woods were awfully quiet, not a sign of animals—save for the birds—or undeads. We managed to evade another group of riders two days ago, we haven't seen or heard from them since, they either got lost or perhaps died at the hands of another monster. Either way, less problems to worry about.</p>

<p>We walked side by side, despite her enormous size, her steps were eerily silent compared to mine, with each step I took a leaf or twig was crushed. But her, not a sound was made. Like she knew where to exactly step to avoid anything that would reveal her presence.</p>

<p>The woods were getting lighter and the trees more scattered, they lost the sinister and eerie atmosphere, the sun was shining and the birds occasionally sang from the tall trees, it felt normal. But my collaborator made sure to destroy any sense of normality.</p>

<p>I looked at her, contemplating her features—her skull in particular. Telling what she was thinking was nigh impossible, nothing to read or see in the emotionless blood-stained ivory. But I can't deny that I wanted to learn more about her, as much as she could remember anyway.</p>

<p>"Say," I said to grab her attention, "You said you don't remember your name or anythin' about your past, right?" She didn't reply, only opting to stare at me with her deep blue eyes, there was a spark of interest and curiosity in them. "I was thinkin' perhaps I could help you."</p>

<p>"Help?" she cocked her head. She seemed surprised with my proposition.</p>

<p>"Yes, help. I'll say some names and see if you would recognize any of them, or if they would ring a bell at the very least." That would be a good way to kill time and try to learn something or two about her.</p>

<p>She didn't reply.</p>

<p>"OK… I'll start, how about… Annie?" Trying to remember as many names as I could.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Amelia?" she shook her head again. This is going to take a while.</p>

<p>"Annabelle, Alice, Agatha Abigail, Beatrice," I didn't intended to go alphabetically but it came out that way, trying to think of names was harder than I expected, "…Belle, Blair, Bonnie ,Catherine, Cait, Delilah, Danielle, Jesse, Erica—"</p>

<p>"Lillian." she interrupted.</p>

<p>I furrowed my brows and looked at her. "What?" </p>

<p>"I like that name."</p>

<p>"It's not about whether you like it or not, we're tryin' to find your name here." I was a bit annoyed with her, "Also, is it the only name you know because I told you it a few days ago?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "I know other names."</p>

<p>"Such as?"</p>

<p>"Conner."</p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes, "And what else?"</p>

<p>She didn't reply. Of course.</p>

<p>"And what about the other names? None of them remind you of anythin' or anyone?"</p>

<p>"No," She shook her head again. "I don't like them."</p>

<p>"Let go through more names first, you might find your name or somethin' you might like more." It was just an excuse so she won't take her name, it felt wrong to give this thing her name, but I can't entirely blame her for liking it, it's a beautiful name.</p>

<p>She huffed, she was annoyed but didn't say anything. She really wanted it.</p>

<p>After going rabid fire through all the girl names I knew, her only response was shaking her head for each single one of them.</p>

<p>"Lillian. I want that name." She's still set on taking her name, I wanted to tell her again we're not picking names here. "I like it." she said before I could reply.</p>

<p>"Do you like it just because it sounds nice or because it was your name?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>I sighed, I didn't want to let her take her name, it would only make it more awkward for me. But at the same time, who am I to deny her a name of her own?</p>

<p>"Fine, you can be called Lillian."</p>

<p>"Thanks." I couldn't see her expression but I could feel she was smiling to herself from her tone. "Lillian. My name." She whispered to herself with a mix of a giggle and wolf's laugh, she seemed happy with herself.</p>

<p>"Do you like your name?" she asked, "Because I do."</p>

<p>"Well, thank you." It's been a long time since anyone said something nice to me, even though it was from a horrible monster complementing a trivial thing such as my name, it was nice.</p>

<p>"How did you get your name?" Quite the curious girl, isn't she.</p>

<p>"Well, It's more of sad story than a funny one," I sighed, it always filled me with great sadness every time it crossed my mind, "I haven't told this to anyone except for Lillian, so you're the first," I didn't see any reason not to tell her, She won't judge, laugh at me or tell anyone. Funny how I felt comfortable talking with her. Her eyes sparked with the prospect of discovering my secrets.</p>

<p>"I had a sister that I never knew, her name was Bonnie, she died before I was born. My grieving mother never got over it and missed her dearly. When she had me she wanted a girl so badly because of how much she missed my sister. But her wishes didn't come true, she named Connor so could call me 'Connie', I think it's clear why. My father didn't know her intention with the name at the time but found it endearing when he did."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." she exhaled </p>

<p>I sighed "Don't be, I never know her."</p>

<p>"You wish you did?" she asked, her tone was empathetic.</p>

<p>"I do, but it doesn't bother me that much, what bothered and truly killed me was my mother, she never got over it, she was in a constant and never endin' state of depression, which only got worse with her hysteria. She later got sick when I was twelve-years-old. My father never remarried after she passed away. He loved her, we loved her." It was hard talking about my mother, a tear escaped my eye. The mere memory of her always put me on the verge of crying, I never talked about it to anyone, the only soul I shared my sorrow with were Lillian, and now this beast.</p>

<p>I could see empathy in her eyes. Knowing she was more than just a feral beast was reassuring, there was a human soul buried deeply inside that beast.</p>

<p>"Of course the other kids bullied me for my name, but I didn't care, she found it cute." I wiped the tear off my face, trying to lighten the gloomy mood a bit.</p>

<p>"Lillian?" she exhaled.</p>

<p>"Yes, the girl with your name." Getting used to this is going to be hard.</p>

<p>"How was she?" she asked</p>

<p>"She was the sweetest girl of them all." I replied with a sad chuckle. "She had mesmerizin' blue eyes, just like you," Her eyes widened from my remark, she seemed flattered, "And beautiful raven hair and her cheeks and nose were covered with cute freckles." </p>

<p>"We were inseparable," I continued "Playin' together all the time, goin' on our little adventure and what not." I wonder how she looks now, we haven't seen each other for almost a decade now, surly age must've only elevated her beauty.</p>

<p>"Adventures?"</p>

<p>I decided to entertain her curiosity. It's been a while since I talked to anyone, and it's probably her only friendly human interaction since the day she was cursed into this thing. Both of us were lonely and miserable.</p>

<p>"We used to play at the outskirts of the woods near our town, we never ventured in it because at the time it seemed scary, well, except for one time. We saw a hare wanderin' around and decided to follow it to the woods and catch it. When we lost track of it we realized how far we went, the woods weren't recognizable anymore and the trees were so thick almost obstructin' the sun entirely, we heard a scary scream and bolted out of the woods in a heartbeat. We thought it was a monster but in retrospect it probably was just a fox or somethin'." I laughed at our childhood misadventure and she listened with great enthusiasm, I could sense a feeling of amusement in her heart.</p>

<p>"I remember this one time we heard a story about some gunslinger," I continued with another story, and she listened carefully. "We asked my father if we could shoot his gun, of course he refused at the time, so instead we stole a bunch of knives and went to our usual spot where we used to play and threw them at the trees, to see which one could stick the most to the tree, she actually beat me that day, before we got in trouble for doin' so."</p>

<p>"Trouble?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, it was mostly me who got the blame, despite it bein' her idea. Anyway, she was ahead of me with two points and I had to catch up. I threw the knife but it went through the trees, a dog whimpered loudly and bolted towards my house, it turned out my dog wandered near the woods without us noticin' and I accidentally hit him. And then her mother saw us." I laughed.</p>

<p>She exhaled, it sounded like a laugh. "What is the dog's name?" Her tail was wiggling, she was enjoying herself. It looked funny to me and couldn't help but chuckle at it.</p>

<p>"William, I thought it would be funny to give him a human name. We called him Bill most of the time. Fortunately, the knife pounced off Bill and he wasn't hurt. I got in trouble while she walked away almost scot-free. Next week my father took us shootin' with him, I suppose it was better to do it under his supervision before we try doin' somethin' stupid again."</p>

<p>"Do you miss her?" She asked, she was really invested in my past.</p>

<p>I sighed, "I do, a lot. It's been a long time since I heard from her. I received a letter from her the day everythin' went to hell. And I lost it." I curse myself everyday for losin' that letter, if I knew it would've been the last memory of her I would've kept it with me. "I wrote to her that I would return in the summer, that was four years ago. She probably finished her studies and became a physician while I'm here, covered in mud and blood—" I pursed my lips, I was about to say talking about my problems with a fucking monster. I made a lot of dumb decisions, but I knew better than to make my partner in crime angry, as she could tear me apart without breaking a sweat. Besides, she's only been kind to me since we met—except for that night. She deserves to be treated with the same kindness she had shown me.</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you go back?" she asked, her tone was empathetic.</p>

<p>"I… I didn't want to put her in danger, my town would be the first place they'll look for me there, there's probably a handful of soldiers or mercenaries waitin' for me to go back." But in reality great shame consumed me, to drag my father's legacy through the mud and come back as both outlaw and deserter to her? "I wonder what she's doin' now, does she think of me as much as I do?" I hoped she does.</p>

<p>She went silent for a moment before asking, "Do you like our adventure?"</p>

<p>Her question caught me off guard and I didn't know how to respond, "It's nothin' like what I had before, it's… unique." but I hated it, I couldn't tell her that nor wanted to lie. "Do you like it?" I didn't know why I said that but it came out automatically.</p>

<p>"I do." she answered, "Hunting, eating, sleeping. That's all I did before I found you. With you around, I feel alive again. Makes me feel human. I forgot how it felt." </p>

<p>"How long have you been like this?" I didn't know what else to say, I felt sorry for her.</p>

<p>She stopped to think, "I don't know. I can't remember when I wasn't like this. I can't remember how I looked." she said with a defeated tone. Her tail stopped wiggling and hung limply as she dragged it behind her.</p>

<p>"We will find out one day, I promise." All I could do to her is offer my sympathy. To lose your humanity and forget the person you once were, trapped in a monstrous body. Such a miserable and horrifying existence, how hasn't she gone mad by now? </p>

<p>She looked at me and her eyes sparked with hope, rejoicing with the prospect of me helping her remember who she once was. What did I get myself into?</p>

<p>After our conversation had ended, my stomach reminded me of how hungry I was. I kept my eyes and ears open for anything we might be able to hunt. </p>

<p>After roughly two hours of walking, I heard some ducks quacking and water flowing in the distance. Finally something to eat. I hope the ducks look normal.</p>

<p>I took the shotgun off my back and trod carefully, she saw me sneaking around and took a lower posture as well. I didn’t bother to tell her to be quiet as she was already as silent as the night.</p>

<p>As we got closer, we found the source of the quacking, a pond hiding behind trees and bushes with a small flock of ducks swimming in it, roughly a dozen or more. There was a small stream feeding the pond and keeping a steady flow of new and fresh water. </p>

<p>The duck seemed happy as they swam and played, occasionally diving their head underwater. It almost made me feel bad for disturbing their peace.</p>

<p>"I'll handle this." I gestured to her to stay where she was, she nodded and stayed in place.</p>

<p>The ducks were really far and I doubted she could catch them before flying away. Hunting ducks with buckshot would be hard, and most likely ruin a good chunk of the meat, but I have to work with what I have.</p>

<p>I sneaked with slow and careful steps, getting as close as I could without alerting the flock of my presence. I had a clear shot on them, but I waited till they were close to each other, to increase my odds of hitting them. When three of them lined up together, I took it as my chance to shoot the ducks.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and squeezed the trigger, releasing a loud boom that sent the flock to the sky. Two unfortunate ducks stayed where they were. Quickly aiming to the sky, firing the entire tube in quick succession at the fleeing birds. Two more fell in the ponds while the rest flew away.</p>

<p>With a click signaling that the tube was empty, I lowered the shotgun. I didn't bother reloading as they were too far to hit. I looked at what I got, four ducks floating and staining the water with their blood.</p>

<p>Before I could react she bolted and jumped straight in the water, she reemerged shortly after with the ducks dangling from her ivory maw.</p>

<p>At least  my hunting dog saved me from the trouble of getting wet.</p>

<p>She swam back and dropped them at my feet. Shaking the water off like a dog, covering me in water as well. </p>

<p>"Thanks," I wiped my face with the poncho, she could've done that far away from me but OK, at least the water washed the blood off her skull, it made her look less scary. I picked the ducks and looked around, "Let's find somewhere to rest and eat." It was past noon already, it was warm enough that being wet didn't bother me that much.</p>

<p>She picked my rifle and satchel where she dropped them and I slung the shotgun on my back after loading it, thank God she didn't jump with my satchel. </p>

<p>I went to the stream first and filled both my canteen and the empty liquor flask and we were on our way. What I would do for a bottle of booze right now…</p>

<p>We didn't walk for long until we found a place to rest, a big tree next to a small slope surrounded with bushes and the grass was tall. Good spot to rest and cook, offer some concealment. I sat the birds next to the tree trunk and began collecting some twigs and wood for the fire. She threw my stuff next to the ducks and walked to the trees and disappeared.  </p>

<p>I didn't ask where she's going, it was a habit of her to go and scan the area for anything, making sure nothing is lurking in the woods, and to look for something to hunt. She found nothing that might be dangerous so far, and not much luck with hunting either.</p>

<p>I gathered all the wood in a pile and threw some dried leaves as a fire starter. I took a match from my pocket and struck it and lit the pile, I blew on it until the fire began burning, adding more wood to feed the flame. I took a couple of the flatter rocks and sat it next to flames.</p>

<p>While my makeshift pan was getting hot I went to work on the ducks.</p>

<p>I sat next to the fire and began plucking the first duck. I was thinking about this monster again, she's the only thing that has been occupying my mind from the moment we met.</p>

<p>She never seemed hungry despite not eating for two days, her maw was always covered in blood so it was hard to tell if she was eating behind my back or not. </p>

<p>Perhaps she saw how disgusted I was from that buck-thing and didn't want to bring something like it again. How kind of her to be thinking of me, but I would've appreciated some mystery meat over starving.</p>

<p>With the duck butt naked it was more apparent how much the buckshot pellets had ruined the meat, shredding a good chunk of the breasts and crushing the bones. I took my knife and removed the pellets before gutting the poor fellow. Throwing its intestines away but keeping the heart and liver.</p>

<p>I put the duck hot rock and it began sizzling the second it made contact with it.</p>

<p>I did the same with the remaining ducks, when I finished the last duck and put them all on the fire alongside their hearts and livers. I spied something white hiding inside the push in front of me. I went to check what it was, it seemed like mushrooms.</p>

<p>When I got closer it was indeed what I assumed it was, a big cluster of button mushrooms hiding behind and inside the bush. I knelt and began inspecting them making sure they're actually edible. Checking the first fungi, it looked like t a normal button mushroom, it had a dirty white color to it with an earthy aroma, like normal mushrooms. I picked all the mushrooms and went back to the fire. Finally something nice for once. Grilling them next to the ducks.</p>

<p>The ducks were far from done but the hearts and liver finished cooking already so I snacked on them, a pinch of salt was all that was missing, I sat next to the fire waiting for the main course to finish, and her to return. The smell of roasted duck and fat filled the air, only made me more hungry.</p>

<p>I took the least damaged duck off the fire first, it was done. I removed the mushrooms a long time ago and ate half of them, they tasted great with a smoky flavor to them, I saved the other half for her. She'll probably like them, although she seemed to favor meat.</p>

<p>Waiting a bit so my meal could cool a bit. I munched on bird, it was juicy, fatty and savory with the smokey and slightly charred taste from the unconventional cooking method. It didn't ruin it but gave it a unique taste. All that was missing was just some salt and pepper to bring more flavor. It tasted good nonetheless, except for the occasional broken bones I kept accidentally chewing on.</p>

<p>When I was almost finished with my duck I saw her approaching our minimalist camp.</p>

<p>"What took you so long?" I asked, eating the last bit of meat on the duck’s thigh. "Found anyone or anythin'?"</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head. As she got closer I noticed her skull was stained with red again, my suspicion seemed to be true.</p>

<p>"Good," at least we're safe here. "Here take one." I invited her to eat, but she looked at me and didn't say anything, "Come on, there's more than enough for me and you helped me catch them."</p>

<p>She drew near me and sat next to me towering over me, too close for my liking.</p>

<p>She took one of the ducks and wolfed the entire thing in one bite, munching and crushing the bones like they were nothing before swallowing loudly and licking her maw. It was hard to ignore the sight while it was sitting only a foot away from me. Her tail was excited, wiggling like it had a mind of its own. She was enjoying her meal.</p>

<p>I took another duck, and she did too. I was still hungry, I could go for maybe another whole duck, "I found some mushrooms, you like mushrooms?" I asked her, pointing at the grilled fungi.</p>

<p>After she finished wolfing her second duck she looked at me like she was thinking, "I do." she finally let out, in all honesty I was half expecting she would respond with her usual 'I don't know'</p>

<p>She took some of the mushrooms. Chewing on them with her human mouth that hid in her the bestial skull.</p>

<p>"Did you hunt and eat something while you were gone? Is that why it took you so long this time?" I asked.</p>

<p>She looked at me like she did something wrong, her ears were flat and tail sat stiffly hugging her rear. I didn't mean to accuse her with my question.</p>

<p>"There's not many things to hunt in these parts, most animals have died, the birds are hard to catch, always hiding in the trees or deep in water, hunters rarely wander here." And I almost forgot she's a man-eater. "I found a dead animal and ate, but there wasn't enough, didn't have enough meat, still hungry." She avoided looking at me.</p>

<p>I sighed and took the leg for myself and gave her the rest, "Take it, I'm full anyway." I already ate half the duck.</p>

<p>She cocked her head, she seemed hesitant at first but she took the bird and ate it. It's probably not enough to satisfy her hunger but it's all I could do. I don't want to wake up to her trying to eat me in case she can't control her hunger.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the last time you ate cooked meat?" I asked, her body relaxed.</p>

<p>"I don't" she shook her head after swallowing her duck, as I expected, "Tastes better. Tender, soft. More flavor." </p>

<p>"Glad you're enjoyin' it" I munched on mine while she ate the last few mushrooms.</p>

<p>The sun was getting down and darker already, cooking those ducks took longer than I expected. We made good progress today so it's fair to call it a day here.</p>

<p>Throwing the bones aside and licking my fingers, she was snacking on the mushrooms, she was about to eat the last one but stopped.</p>

<p>"I want you to have it." she said, extending her claw and offering the last fungi.</p>

<p>"Nah I already ate my share, it's yours."</p>

<p>"I insist" she exhaled.</p>

<p>I shrugged, there's really no reason to argue over a mushroom.</p>

<p>"Thanks, but you really didn't have to." I ate it in one bite. "I suppose we can rest here for the day" the flame was reduced to lazily glowing embers, I didn't bother to stomp on them, as they would offer some warmth for the night, although very little.</p>

<p>I unbuckled my gun belt and bandolier and put them aside, while keeping the navy tucked in my belt. Me and that gun never parted ways, always staying on me. I feared I might lose it or accidentally forget it. It was one of the few things to remind me of my old life.</p>

<p>I laid next to the dying flames and covered my face with my hat, trying to get as comfortable as I could on the grass. I felt something, or rather someone, moving next to me, she was trying to sleep with me, again.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to say without sounding mean, but I had to, this shit was driving me insane, always intruding in my personal space and wanting to sleep and cuddle with me.</p>

<p>"Could you... Sleep somewhere else?" I removed my hat and saw her skull staring at me.</p>

<p>"Why?" she tilted her head, "I want to sleep with you, I like sleeping with you."</p>

<p>There's no other way to say it, I have to be blunt with her. "I don't feel... Comfortable with you doin' that." </p>

<p>A hollow stare was her only response, the sun had already set and shadows obstructed her eyes, stripping away what little humanity she had. She crawled away on all four without saying a word and laid on the tall grass far away from me, sleeping like how a dog would. </p>

<p>I wasn't sure whether she was mad or sad from what I said to her. But what am I supposed to do? It felt wrong, it was wrong. I can't let her get attached to me, and I can't get attached to her.</p>

<p>I sighed and covered my face with the hat again. I don't hate her, but I don't like her either. I pity her. Yeah, it's just pity. I hope I didn't hurt her feelings. There is still a human soul deep in her. I fear that I might grow to like her.</p>

<p>Closing my eyes to get some sleep, but my conscience kept tormenting me for being mean to the man-eating monster. "Goodnight… Lillian." I said in a somewhat loud voice so that she could hear it, she was my only true ally after all.</p>

<p>She didn't respond. Saying her name was hard and awkward.</p>

<p>Sleep finally came, sweet and restful void.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>Rough noose hugging my neck, flimsy platform under my feet, a bored sheriff not giving a fuck about the man who's about to get hanged.</p>

<p>Again at the gallows, the only thing I could see was a sea of heads waiting eagerly for me to get hanged. They hate my guts, the only thing that would please them is seeing my limp body swing from the gallows.</p>

<p>The ugly priest was about to start his speech but I cut him short.</p>

<p>"What is wrong with you people! You've got nothin' better to do! Gatherin' just to watch an innocent man hang!" The priest looked at me like I just cursed the Virgin Mary herself, the crowd got angrier and hurled all sorts of curses and insults at me. "YOU'RE CURSES MEANS NOTHIN'!—" a gun shot brought the angry crowd into a halt, the flimsy gallows vibrated from that shot. I looked to my right and the sheriff was holding his pistol to the sky. His expression changed, he wasn't bored anymore, rather a mix of annoyance and disdain drew on his face.</p>

<p>"Innocent my ass." He holstered his pistol and slowly walked towards me, "I should put a bullet in your head for just darin' to conspire with that monster of yours." He looked at me with his tired eyes, like he was judging my soul and core.</p>

<p>"Tell me mister," He said once he got close enough to confront me face to face, "Do you know how many you have murdered? How many have you robbed and ruined their lives?" He didn't wait for my answer and continued, "Too many to count, too many to care. And to what end? To come back to a life that hates you? To a girl that doesn't remember you? And if she still does remember you, will she accept you after disappearin' for the better part of a decade or forgive you after learnin' what you did and with whom you’ve been?” As much as you like tellin' yourself otherwise, you're no better than the common bandit, at least they have the decency to know and admit who they are."</p>

<p>"You'll probably lie to her," He said with a dismissive wave, "Fabricatin' a web of lies so she would take you in, she might believe it, if she still truly loves you. But truth will eventually emerge and lies are fragile. And once they collapse, you'll hang by its threads."</p>

<p>He slid his hand to his pocket, taking out something that reflected the sun directly in my eyes. I closed my eyes to avoid the blinding reflection. When I opened my eyes again, I saw what he was holding: a ring, a simple silver ring without any identifiable features. "Such a simple thing, isn't it? I found it in a dead man's pocket, the man you've killed. The same ring you cursed yourself for touchin'. He had a girl that he loved, just like you, and now she's waitin' for him to return not knowin' that he had died a long time ago. You denied her her only wish. So tell me, what gives you the right to get away with it? To return to your old life and live peacefully with your girl and he and his girl don’t? You tell me, mister, is it fair?"</p>

<p>I didn't—couldn't respond. I knew he was right, I just looked at my feet, avoiding his gaze.</p>

<p>He sighed and wiped the sweat off his forehead. "Was it worth it? To save that kid and ruin your life? At least he had a chance in life but at the cost of yours, so again. Do you regret it?"</p>

<p>I looked up, "I don't," I replied, making sure to say loudly and clearly. "I regret nothin'. And I'll still do it again fully knowin' how it will end." I looked him dead in the eyes.</p>

<p>He smiled, "At least you have the decency to own it, I like it. But it won't be enough to save you, death is a mercy to the likes of you. Don't hate me for pulling the lever, I'm here to deliver justice and save you a life of disappointment and sorrow." he walked to the lever</p>

<p>He didn't cover my face with the hood. He looked at me and I looked at him.</p>

<p>The crowd was silent, I almost forgot they were there, the sheriff was right, everything he said was right. I hated to admit it, hell, I even hated to acknowledge it. I just wanted him to pull this damn lever and be done with it. The shame and guilt was killing me.</p>

<p>He didn't break eye contact as he pulled the lever, the sudden drop did.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>This time I woke up before my neck snapped, I grasped for air but couldn't, a hand firmly clutching on my face, holding my mouth shut is what stopped me.</p>

<p>Eyes wide open, I tried to scream but only muffled sounds came out. A man masked in a dark cloak was on top of me, holding his knife and about to strike the blade into my heart.</p>

<p>I raised my right hand hopping to catch his hand but instead the knife pierced my palm, planting itself in my hand. Warm blood dripped on my face. I cried in pain but she didn't hear a thing, she was too far to hear my muffled cries. How in hell's name did he manage to sneak on us!</p>

<p>He tried to pull the knife away for another stab but I clinched on his fist, when retrieving the knife didn't work he began pushing.</p>

<p>The ill formed moon shone, illuminating the attempt at my slaughter ever so slightly, revealing the eyes of my murderer, and all I could see was panic in them. Pure terror and fear accumulating in his eyes. The look of a man who knew he fucked up if I ever knew one. It wasn't supposed to go that way, I was supposed to be dead, sleeping with a dagger in my heart. But now his plan has been ruined, he feared the sounds of struggles or smell of blood might wake up the beast that was sleeping.</p>

<p>The stalker pushed, putting all his strength and weight to this strike. His other hand held my face harder.</p>

<p>Using both hands to hold him off, but the blade didn't stop, it only drew closer and closer to my neck. He kept pushing and I kept struggling.</p>

<p>It was going longer than he anticipated, each second he wasted he risked waking the beast.</p>

<p>My guns were too far to reach, and the blade was too near to my flesh, the navy was still hiding in my belt. I could try and reach for it but it would be too risky, if I was one second too slow, it would end before I had a chance. But I'd die anyway if I didn't try.</p>

<p>Putting all my faith in this risky gambit, I retreated my left hand and reached for the pistol, before getting hold of the grip, the knife planted itself in my left shoulder, pinning my right arm to my chest. A surge of sharp and electrifying pain went all over my body as iron pierced the flesh and hit the bone. I cried but nothing could be heard.</p>

<p>I pushed through the pain and grabbed the pistol and cocked the hammer and—with great pain—drew the navy and squeezed the light trigger, shooting him in the guts.</p>

<p>The attacker let out a loud and painful cry, "YOU SONUVABTICH" he yanked the knife violently, freeing my hand, he went for another stab. The fear in his eyes was gone, now replaced with hatred and anger, he knew he was dead, not just from the shot, but from the Daemon that would wake soon, there's no escape from it, what he only wanted now is to finish the job and get his revenge on me. Another shot to the heart cut him short, his limp body fell on top of me.</p>

<p>"CONNOR!" the Daemon howled, the woman's voice gone, only the Daemonic wolf could be heard, it sounded like it came straight from hell. It ran shivers down my spine. Thank God she's on my side.</p>

<p>I pushed the dead man off me, "Still breathin'," I said. I was about to stand up but a muffled shot nearly missing my face sent me back to the ground, it hit the tree next to me instead.</p>

<p>Lying next to the dead stalker and using his body as cover. I couldn't see anything to shoot at, "There's another man in the woods!" I alerted her, and like the wind she bolted straight towards the woods.</p>

<p>A terrorized scream that came to an abrupt stop followed by flesh getting torn and bones crushed. The images these sounds painted in my mind, I just wished they left us alone...</p>

<p>There were at least two men stalking us for days, God knows how many are hiding and lurking in the shadows. How the fuck did they manage to do it?! She didn't smell or sense anything.</p>

<p>The cold breeze blew on my seeping wounds, almost freezing the blood, the pain was already unbearable. I put the navy back in my belt and went for the dead man, he must be carrying bandages on him, or for the very least I could use his cloak to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p>He was wearing a hooded dark cloak with leaves all over it for camouflage, on his heart he had a pin, the corps insignia. Damn them, they're not giving up on her that easily, why is she so important to them anyway?</p>

<p>As I searched the man I noticed that his clothes had a weird oily texture to them, and there was no smell to the stalker—save for the iron from his blood. No smell of sweat or anything. This oil must be masking their scent… </p>

<p>He had an odd looking revolver, the barrel was replaced with a thicker and longer cylinder, it looked bizarre, I haven't seen anything like it before. I wasn't sure what purpose it served.</p>

<p>Opening his pouches—and thank God— he had bandages in them. I hastily wrapped my hand and shoulder, aching with each motion I did. Blood already soaked the fabric as soon as I was finished.</p>

<p>After I was done I went through his pockets, he had some money on him, I stuffed them in my pocket without counting them.</p>

<p>I couldn't take the pain any longer, so I reached for my satchel and took the medicine bottle and drank it, this time a larger dose than the first time. The effects kicked in almost immediately after swallowing the tasteless drug. The pain had gone, all sensation in my body too, my body felt light and relaxed. I was getting dizzy and could barely stay awake.</p>

<p>"Conner, are you alright? Are you hurt?" A feminine voice called, filled with worry.</p>

<p>"I'm alright I'm alreight… still standin'…" I replied, the drug was strong, I might lose consciousness any moment now. "Did you get him? How many were there?"</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>One? Just a team of two were after us? More must be lurking in the dark "We need to leave now! Others might be on their way or hidin'!" I hastily wore my gun belt and hat, I might've drank too much, my legs could barely hold the weight of my body, she picked the rest of my gears, "let's go—" Before I could finish she carried me with one arm—making sure not to hurt me with her claws—like a sack of grains and bolted. I didn't know where we were going but she seemed to know.</p>

<p>I was too dizzy and sleepy to protest and tell her to drop me, fighting to stay awake while she carried me. The wind hit my face and ran through my hair, it felt nice, almost like I was flying. I held my hat so it wouldn't fly off.</p>

<p>I couldn't resist resting my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them again, I found that we had stopped and my hat was gone. There were no stars or crescent moon, and I couldn't feel the wind or see anything. She must've taken us to a cave or something. I heard a metallic clang hit the floor. Both claws gently enveloped me, manhandling and manipulating me like a doll, she pulled me into a tight embrace before lying on the stone cold floor.</p>

<p>Her soft breast pressing against my face, she's comfortable and warm, and I was tired, both from the drug and from the attempt on my life. I couldn't help but close my eyes. For the second time, the drug prevented me from protesting, but this time I didn't want to, I felt safe in her embrace. Nothing would hurt me as long as she's close.</p>

<p>"Goodnight, Connie." Her sweet voice was the last thing I remembered before falling asleep again. In the end she got what she wanted.</p>

<p>"Goodnight…" I exhaled.</p>

<p>This time, I didn't dream of no gallows or executions, I was back in my old house, drinking tea with Lillian. We didn't say a word to one another, but she was happy that I'm back, I was too.</p>

===CHAPTER7===
<p>The sun was warm, the breeze was nice, the birds were singing and leaves rustling. It was a lovely day, it felt more like a picnic really, and she was like my trusty hound, carrying my rifle and satchel while the shotgun slung on my back, the only thing that was missing was some cakes. A great contrast from the ambush two nights ago.</p>

<p>"Well, my days in the army were a bit more interesting than the average soldier." She was curious about what I did in the army, I didn't see any reason not to tell her, but I didn't want to go into details about it either. Bad memories still linger. </p>

<p>"I served in a specialized unit," I continued, "The whole purpose of that unit was to track down and kill confederate boys and guerrillas that were too proud to surrender. At best those rebels were a nuisance, kidnappin' random people or doin' small sabotage operations that went nowhere and achieved very little." I said waving my hands in the air, "And at worst they were a genuine national threat. Countless attempts at assassinatin' presidents—with an alarmin' success rate." She listened very carefully with her ears standing upright and pointing towards me, I just noticed how large they really were. They were tall and fuzzy, kind of cute, if one could look past the skull.</p>

<p>"It genuinely baffles me, why would they still be fightin' for almost thirty years after their rebellion had failed, and somehow shows no signs of stoppin'. There's some veterans from the war with them, but the vast majority of their forces are younger men and women, the veterans took the role of commanders and whatnot, but some of them with their men just to kill Yankees one last time or something I suppose. A weird bunch, borderline the fanatics—" A sound in the distance interrupted me. </p>

<p>Hooves stomping the ground could be heard not far from us, and the creaking of a wagon’s wheels too.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the noise I immediately hugged the ground and told her to do so in a hushed voice, she laid flat next to me. They probably couldn't see us in the woods but I didn't want to risk it.</p>

<p>It appears we've been trailing next to a road without knowing. The wagon and horses got louder as they were approaching at a rather snail’s pace, they weren't in a hurry. I could hear the drivers talking about something, eavesdropping on their conversation once they got into a hearing distance.</p>

<p>I relaxed for a moment. For a second I thought they might be with the army, but no, they were just a bunch of traders heading to Valentine too, talking about how much money they're going to make once they get there. They won't be a problem to us.</p>

<p>One of the men asked his partner how far they were from the town, he replied a day or two most likely. Huh, we're not that far away. Finally, this nightmare would end soon.</p>

<p>We stayed hugging the dirt for a little bit longer until we couldn't hear them conversing about their genius business scheme or their old wagon that could use some maintenance. I stood up and groaned, a dull pain in my shoulder hit me. That stab still ached me. The drug masked the pain and stopped the bleeding, but some of the pain remains.</p>

<p>"Still hurts?" She asked softly, standing from her lying position as well, her eyes and tone were filled with concern and worry.</p>

<p>"It does, but I can handle it." I replied, "Anyway, as I was sayin'." Those words grabbed her full attention as we continued our journey to Valentine. </p>

<p>"I don't know why they're still fightin', what do they see in this failed state of theirs? Most of those who originally fought in the war are long dead now or too old for this. I assume it's a matter of principle for them or something. Too proud to admit defeat." I shrugged.</p>

<p>She seemed lost in thoughts, "Why do you fight?" she finally let out.</p>

<p>"Why do I fight?" I wasn't expecting this question. Stopping to think about it, why am I doing this? All of this? "For her, for Lillian I suppose." I answered after a long moment. But I wasn't sure, it felt like an excuse for all the bad things I did. Convincing myself it wasn't just for me, but for someone else, made it easier to justify. But it felt… selfish.</p>

<p>"I deserted the army after they tried to kill me. Well, it was for killin' Baker’s brother."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, tilting her head. "Why Did you kill him?"</p>

<p>I didn't—couldn't answer her, words stuck in my throat like thorns, I wanted to say, to tell someone about it, to hear my side of the story. But it hurts, saying it hurts, just thinking about it wounds me… </p>

<p>"It hurts to remember?" she said softly, a hint of sadness and empathy in her voice.</p>

<p>"It does." I let out sheepishly.</p>

<p>The bitter taste of sad and awkward silence fell in the air. </p>

<p>"It was only natural that a bounty hunter would come looking for me at some point or another," I broke the silence, "It didn't take long for the first fool to try his luck with my bounty, unfortunately for him, his bounty huntin' career ended the day it started." I said with a smile, trying to lighten the mood with some gallows' humor.<br />
"He had a wanted poster of me in his pocket and they used an older photograph of me, unlike most people, I was smiling in mine, I suppose that's why they wrote 'Deranged' over it" I joked, and I got a chuckle out of her, it sounded human.</p>

<p>"You don't look deranged." She said with a laugh. "You look lovely."</p>

<p>I let that ferment in the air for a moment. Such a weird thing to hear. Not that I hated it, it just… feels odd.</p>

<p>"At least I found you." she said, like she had always been looking for me—or the man that I resampled</p>

<p>"Yeah…" I paused for a long moment, "at least you found me…"</p>

<p>One thought haunted my mind, who the fuck was she?</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>We walked for the remainder of the day and the sun was about to sleep. I tried to learn more about her, but again, it went nowhere, I swear this creature would be the end of me.</p>

<p>I sighed in defeat, some things are not meant to be known I suppose, if she doesn't even know who she was, who would? I doubt her family—if they were alive to begin with—would recognize her, I reckon she probably would, but how am I supposed to find them? I don't have time for this.</p>

<p>"I suppose we can rest here." I said to her, we reached a place where trees could offer a decent cover, in case any more travelers decided for whatever to venture to the woods.</p>

<p>She nodded and gave me my stuff, then went to scout the area—leaving me alone. The sun had already slept and the moon wasn't there to keep me company. Those moonless nights—where nothing could be seen—always made me feel uneasy, especially with her gone now. The dark void hid the unknown, and it felt like it would devour me any moment now. </p>

<p>Having the shotgun at the ready, I sat and leaned against one of the trees, the roots were exposed and grew in a way that resampled a chair's arms rests, giving it the appearance of a throne. It was surprisingly comfortable, and I was tired from all this walking.</p>

<p>I wasn't hungry as we ate this morning, she caught a normal buck this time, another sign we were getting closer and closer to civilization and leaving the cursed woods for good.</p>

<p>I relaxed for a moment but didn't lower my guard. Without her I was vulnerable and an easy target for the picking. I hugged the shotgun for anything that might be stalking in the dark.</p>

<p>I felt something approaching and aimed the Winchester at it, "It's safe." A familiar voice exhaled, it was her. I lowered the gun, It didn't take her long to come back. The woods were quiet, but after that night, the silence now had an eerie and odd quality to it.</p>

<p>She went to sleep far away from me like how I used to tell her, lying there like a dog. I looked at her for a moment and stood, taking my gear with me and went to sleep with her. Resting my back against the soft fur, she seemed surprised with it, but didn't say a word, nor did I.</p>

<p>I didn't want that ambush to happen again.</p>

<p>I covered my face with my hat and closed my eyes. I felt her gently placing her claw on my lap, she seemed a bit hesitant. I didn't push it away, rather decided to put my hand over it, it felt… weird. It felt wrong, but I felt safe, and somewhat… loved.</p>

<p>Her chest rising and falling with each soft breath, her relaxed heartbeat was soothing like a lullaby. And her warmth, too, like warm and thick blankets on winter nights. It made sleeping easier. I petted her claw gently, feeling the soft and long fur between my fingers with each stroke. It's bizarre how gentle and pet-like she could be sometimes.</p>

<p>She's the only thing keeping me alive, I should stay by her side at all times. I hate to admit it, but I grew to enjoy her company.</p>

<p>"Goodnight." I finally said after long minutes of playing with her hand.</p>

<p>She didn't reply, her breathing became slower and softer, more rhythmic. She had already fallen asleep. She didn't hear me.</p>

<p>I should probably do the same.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>The blue hue and cool breeze of dawn woke me up from a pleasant dream I couldn't quite remember. It felt nice and refreshing from the oppressive nightmares that I was growing accustomed to. My body was well rested and ready to embark, but I stayed for an extra moment to relax. It was early.</p>

<p>She was still sleeping and her claw still on me. Usually she would wake up before me, but this time I beat her. I didn't wake her up right away, instead I played with her hand for a while, her sleepy ears twitching every time I touched her. It was amusing, a little bit too amusing. It felt like I was petting a dog. not a creature that came straight from hell.</p>

<p>With this much teasing she finally lifted her head and looked at what was disturbing her slumber. Her blue eyes were sleepy and annoyed with me.</p>

<p>"Rise and shine, sleepyhead." I couldn't help but smile gaily at her. Her eyes were human—almost enough to make me forget what she was.</p>

<p>She stood—pushing me aside and stretched, letting out a big yawn.</p>

<p>"Slept well?" I asked while wearing my gears.</p>

<p>She looked at me after finishing her morning routine "I did." She exhaled. </p>

<p>Something had just occurred to me, "Say, do you dream?" An odd question but I was wondering what would this creature dream of—if she could dream at all.</p>

<p>She paused for a long moment, thinking, like she never knew what the word 'dream'  ever meant. "I do," she let out.</p>

<p>"About what?" I was somewhat surprised—and curious.</p>

<p>"Hunting. Eating." I was half expecting this answer, and I was a bit disappointed. "Sometimes," She continued, but not before taking a long pause. "I dream of my old life. Only fragments and foggy memories. Hard to explain."</p>

<p>I finished buckling my gun belt, "Could you try?" I couldn't deny I was excited to learn about her. Finally, this investigation was going somewhere.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, I dream of my old life. Before this. Walking in a house I don't recognize. Talking with faceless people. I can't understand what they say, or remember who were they. But they seem to understand me. Know me." She paused, trying to remember, "And there's a man, the only one with a face, you remind me of him." She said, pointing her sharp long claw at me, "I loved him."</p>

<p>"Do you remember who that man was? Your relation with him? Was he your lover or perhaps husband?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "All I know is that I loved him," she paused, "Sometimes, I dream of being inside a house. There's a mirror, when I look at it. All I see is a headless woman."</p>

<p>"Is that woman… You?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>She doesn't remember much of her life, not her family, not the man she loved—she can't even remember herself. Incomplete and fragmented memories were the only things she inherited from her past life. What a miserable and sad existence.</p>

<p>Why did I expect this would go anywhere? I'm so close to Valentine and won't have to deal with this anymore, soon I'll be free.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>It was getting dark already as we hiked to Valentine. On the way she talked more about her dreams, they were vague and went nowhere. One time she's sitting on a table and eating unidentifiable food, another where she's gazing at a featureless field.</p>

<p>I felt obliged to talk about my dreams as well, mine were usually on the shorter side, I rarely had long dreams, which made it feel like a special occasion whenever I had one. My dreams almost always involved some sort of mutilation. Cutting my fingers, pulling my teeth, ripping my skin off. They stopped bothering me a long time ago.</p>

<p>I shared with her the gallows and woods nightmares, and she listened very carefully. She seemed more invested in the woods dream.</p>

<p>Listening to me yapping probably became her favorite pastime at this point. I didn't mind as I actually enjoyed it. Talking with someone was refreshing, and she was a great listener.</p>

<p>We climbed a slope that led us to the top of a small hill. I almost slipped on the way up, but she climbed effortlessly on all four—or rather three as one hand was busy carrying my gear.</p>

<p>From atop the hill we could see a town, the town where all of this had started. Its lights were shining, people wandering around like ants—in groups or alone—going about their business unaware of the outlaw and his beast spying on them.</p>

<p>Valentine was a big town that was on its way to become a city. Many new businesses and factories were under construction, attracting people of all sorts, traders and workers alike. But that raised a problem, too many people. Too many people will see me and raise suspicion, an ex-criminal—probably presumed dead—comes back. People might still try their luck with the bounty. Not knowing that I've been pardoned.</p>

<p>I looked at my companion that helped me through all of this journey, I found her lost in thoughts, gazing a gazeless stare at the town before us. The lights had a mesmerizing effect on her, or perhaps it was the annoying amount of people there that caught her attention, probably thinking how much meat was in that town.</p>

<p>She looked at me and our eyes met, there was enough daylight to see but shadows began to obstruct them. "How long will it take?" She asked, her voice was happy and filled with hope, "When will you come back?"</p>

<p>She wants me to come back, to stay with her… She grew attached to me and doesn't want me to leave her. But I don't want to come back, I can't come back to her, to this or anything that has to do with her. But do I have the heart to tell her? I could lie, but she would spend the remainder of her days waiting for me, clinging on false hope that I might return one day when I would rather forget about her.</p>

<p>After all we went through, after she helped me reach my goal, after she saved me multiple times, after she kept me company… I grew to like her, and I hated it. She deserves to know the truth.</p>

<p>I broke our gaze, looking back at the town, "I won't come back." I said, "I'll go back to my old love, the girl with your name, and escape out of this country. That if she…" the next part was hard to say, it was the only part of the plan that could horribly go wrong. "That if she still loves me…" I paused, "This will be the last time we see each other."</p>

<p>"You want to. Leave me." Her voice changed, the wolf took control but not fully. "Why." There was a hint of sadness in the woman's voice, but the wolf was angry. </p>

<p>"You hate me. Fear me." She snarled, the voice was daemonic and her eyes disappeared behind the shadows as the sun kept creeping down. </p>

<p>I stepped back after her tone shifted all of a sudden, my hands instinctively reached for my revolvers, almost forgetting the shotgun I had on my back. What stood before ceased to be my companion, it was just a monster. And that monster was angry, angry at me. Primal fear took over me.</p>

<p>I should gun it down, I should run, I should've lied. All these thoughts crept to my mind as the beast got closer, but fear paralyzed my legs. I couldn't do anything but gawk at those sharp, blood-stained fangs and imagine how painful they would feel.</p>

<p>The wolf exhaled and murmured something I couldn't hear and threw the broken rifle and satchel near my feet, leaving without saying another word. Soon it disappeared behind the thick trees. I heard a faint cry that quickly faded with the ambient wind and rustling.</p>

<p>And I was alone again, collapsing immediately on my knees. Breathing was hard, my heart was about to explode, my legs—and entire body—were weak and shaking. For a brief moment I thought it was about to kill me, tear me apart and eat me alive. But she just… left. She was angry, she never talked with me in that voice before. A mix of fear and guilt overtook me, what am I supposed to do? Go and live with the man-eating beast so she won't feel bad and satisfy her desire to be with her lover!? This is absurd, it's my fault for getting attached to her, letting her get attached to me. It should've never happened. I should've never allowed it to happen!</p>

<p>I need to get a hold of myself, soon all of it will turn into mere memories. Memories that would be forgotten with time.</p>

<p>Gathering all the strength I had, I stood back on my feet. Trying to stand unshaken—but my legs betrayed me. Supporting myself on a tree while trying to collect myself.</p>

<p>I fought, and I won. I earned my freedom. And all I had to do was head to Valentine and this nightmare would finally end. I'll see you soon, I promise.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>The sun had already set, but the town didn't sleep. The streets were filled with people of all sorts, businessmen, travelers, workers, even gunmen. The latter were eyeing me suspiciously. Everyone did, but they tried to avoid making it apparent, not wanting to look rude, or perhaps—which was more likely—they feared me.</p>

<p>I couldn't blame them as my appearance was beyond deplorable, I looked like I crawled straight from the grave. Covered in mud and blood, my left shoulder and right sleeve were stained with an ungodly amount of blood from that stab, and that scar she marked me with, I looked like a villain. I tried to hide the gray colors with my dirty poncho. As much as I would liked to replace that coat, I couldn't find anything that didn't have a bullet hole in it—or was torn to shreds and soaked in blood.</p>

<p>I could see the few people that dared to walk next to me were repulsed by my stench, I reeked of wet dogs and death. I tried to ignore them and their inhospitably, it didn't matter as I'll never see this place again.</p>

<p>On my way to the sheriff's office I passed by a new and catchy building, 'The Silver Dog Palace.' was written on it with big and fancy letters. A bit of an odd name for a fancy saloon but the appearance was of one. It was a two story building and it seemed fairly new, and a popular one too, judging from the music and the chatter and laughter that could be heard from the outside, but what really caught my attention was the smell of food. I was hungry, and I would appreciate a well prepared and proper meal. I had more than enough money to go with my plan, a treat won't bankrupt me.</p>

<p>I entered the building, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. But as soon as I stepped in, the saloon owner—I think he was the owner—greeted me, "Good evenin'… Mister…" and everyone stopped what they were doing to look at me, the piano ceased playing, the chatter and laughter came to a halt and the poker players weren't interested in their game anymore. I was the focal point of everyone's attention. And I could sense their distaste of me.</p>

<p>"I don't want to bother you… but no guns are allowed inside the saloon, house policies…." His tone wasn't friendly nor hostile, it was… Awkward, like he was scared of me.</p>

<p>I blinked at him, and he blinked back. He was a short and balding man wearing a white shirt and a fancy black waistcoat, he had big dark eyes for the size of his head and a wide mouth, he was frog-like in appearance, he looked harmless, but also odd.</p>

<p>Behind him there were numbered shelves with dozens and dozens of a wide and diverse assortment of guns, from rifles to pistols in their holsters, some were nicer than others of course as I saw one of them German pistols. I looked around—avoiding making eye contact—and everyone didn't have anything dangling from their hips. They were all unarmed. I almost forgot I was armed to the teeth. "Oh, right." I put the broken rifle on the counter and took the shotgun and bandolier off my back. Unbuckling my gun belt as well. "Here's them all." Keeping one gun hidden in my belt.</p>

<p>He looked at the guns, a bit uncertain, and then at me. He took them and put them in a shelf numbered twenty one and gave a card with the same number. "Have a nice evening…" He said to me, everyone had already returned back to their business, the pianist went on with his music, but it sounded off. The men continued their chatter, but they were whispering now and no one was laughing. The poker player went back to the game but I could feel them stealing a glance or two at me when I wasn't looking. There was an odd quality to the air, I wasn't welcomed here by anyone.<br />
"I will." I said, taking the card, and went to find an empty table. </p>

<p>The saloon was crowded that night. Almost every table had at least one customer, and I had this feeling no one wanted me to share a seat with them. Thankfully there was an empty table in a lonely corner. I took my seat there and waited for the waitress to come, she was busy delivering the order of the table across from me. The three men at the table didn't pay much attention to their food—they were eyeing me specifically. I didn't like it, I looked at my hands, avoiding making eye contact with them. I don't want any trouble, I just want to eat.</p>

<p>When the waitress finished with their plates she came to take my order, the men started eating, but I could feel them still staring at me.</p>

<p>"Good evenin' Mister, What are you havin' tonight?" She asked, in a somewhat bored voice, unlike everyone else here, she was indifferent to my existence.</p>

<p>"Do you serve steak here?" I asked politely.</p>

<p>"Yes we do, it's our signature dish, would you like some roasted potatoes and tomatoes with it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would love to! And some red wine too." She wrote my order and calculated the sum.</p>

<p>"That would be, four dollars and fifty cents."</p>

<p>I took some money out of my pocket and handed her a five dollar bill. She gave me the change and said my order would be ready in no time, then she left.</p>

<p>I removed my hat and rested it on the table, contemplating the feather on it. I feel like shit. Everyone either hates me or doesn't care about me, and the only 'person' who does like me is a man-eating monster and she was mad at me. Uncertainty loomed over me. Thinking about that beast again. I sighed, it's just pity and loneliness, it was the only reason I liked her.</p>

<p>I tapped one the table while I waited, the pianist was playing a sad and slow tone. It wasn't the one I heard from the outside, did he change it because I came in?</p>

<p>After roughly thirty minutes the waitress came back with my order, I straightened my posture and wore my hat again as I saw her approaching. First she placed a glass and a bottle of wine, then the main plate, but something was wrong with it…</p>

<p>"It's raw." I told the waitress, the meat was barely cooked and still red, too red, like it was cooked with a single candle. And I wasn't sure if it was sauce or blood. It wasn't appealing at all, it was repulsive.</p>

<p>"It's how we serve it here." She replied matter-of-factually, "There's this new trend in cooking meat. They call it 'Medium rare' where the meat isn't cooked all the way through, leaving the middle red and juicy. It gives it a richer flavor, you have to try it, Mister."</p>

<p>I looked at the steak again, but what really bothered me—which I omitted mentioning—was that it was unrecognizable where the meat had come from. The bloody and raw nature of it made it look like… the flesh of those mercenaries that the beast killed without a second thought. Killed in the most gruesome and unimaginable way that doesn't fit a human being, just to... protect me…</p>

<p>I was about to open my mouth but she interrupted me, "And no, he won't take it back to cook it some more, the chef is a bit uh… too proud with his cooking, to put it lightly, and would hate to '<em>ruin</em>' a perfect steak."</p>

<p>She left me with my under-cooked meat to attend another customer. I already paid for it and might as well try it. It smelled good, but didn't look that appetizing. At least the potatoes looked nice.</p>

<p>I took the knife and fork and began cutting the meat, it better be good. The thing began oozing its red juices, it was disgusting. I never had issues with meat before, not with the ducks, heck, not even the buck-thing. I knew where they came from and cooked them proper, but this, I didn’t know where it came from nor was it cooked in an appealing way. My mind couldn't stop but imagine it as human flesh.</p>

<p>I took a bite size of the meat—and hesitantly—ate it. Images of gore and blood came in immediately, mangled bodies, spelled guts and the screams of the men she killed. All of them flashing in my mind..</p>

<p>I swallowed the meat, it made me feel sick. I washed it down with some wine straight from the bottle, and went for another bite, but I was already disgusted from the first. As soon as I put the flesh in my mouth, the images came back, this time more grotesque and bloodier than before.</p>

<p>Bodies broken like dolls, joints bent the wrong way and lifeless eyes staring at me, everything was covered in blood. <strong>blood</strong>. <strong>BLOOD</strong>. I couldn't hold it any longer, my body was rejecting it. I spat the meat and puked. Coughing as my stomach was being emptied from what little food and drink it had.</p>

<p>The whole place went quiet, no more whispers, no more music, everyone was looking at me. I was the focal point of their attention once again.</p>

<p>I had to leave. I left the wine and my meal and went back to the frog-man. He saw me approaching and went to get my guns, he seemed stressed and worried, I had a feeling it had nothing to do the meal.</p>

<p>"Here's your belongings Mister—" I threw the card at the table, and wore my gear without saying a word. I felt sick. "I…I hope there wasn't anythin' wrong with the food…" I left without saying a word and found myself back in the streets, the fresh cool air hit my face, and I realized I was sweating. </p>

<p>I have to find this sheriff and be done with it.</p>

<p>I walked to the sheriff's office, it wasn't far from the saloon, only a couple of minutes away. But the streets were empty. Less than an hour ago they were crowded, it was strange, it wasn't even that late.</p>

<p>I heard the saloon’s door open behind me, I didn't look but I had a feeling that someone was following me, perhaps they still wanted the bounty on my head, even though I got pardoned—or presumed dead. But I doubt they would do anything once I get to the sheriff.</p>

<p>I turned the corner and saw the office. It was an older and smaller building compared to the rest of the town. It only had two one-man cells in there. I suppose this town doesn't see much action.</p>

<p>I entered the office and saw the deputy behind bars lying on one of the beds, reading his book with the aid of an oil lamp. The sheriff was at his desk dealing with some paperwork with a cigar lazily hanging from his lips.</p>

<p>"Come back later, don't you see me busy right now?" The sheriff said without bothering to look up at who just came to see him. The deputy on the other hand glanced at me, his expression shifted immediately and his eyes widened as if Satan himself had entered the office. He threw the book and snapped upright, drawing his pistol at me, without hesitation he cocked the gun.</p>

<p>"Got a lot of nerve to show yourself here, Deadman." He said, his voice was uncertain, he struggled to keep his hand steady.</p>

<p>"The hell are you talkin' about—" The sheriff looked up to see whom his deputy was threatening, and when he saw who it was his jaw dropped, immediately rising from his chair and drawing his gun at me too, the paper scattered all over the floor like worthless leaves. "The hell you're doin' here!" He barked at me.</p>

<p>I furrowed my brow in confusion , "What? What are you talkin' about? I came for the deal you promised me, remember?" I blurted. They were treating me like a common bandit. They weren't expecting me to come back.</p>

<p>"The deal is over," The sheriff replied, "You're a fool for comin' here, thinkin' we would still help you after what you did."</p>

<p>What I did? The fuck is he talking about?! "I did as I was told! I fought death more than once and I won! I earned my freedom! I earned it with my blood and sweat!" I snapped at him, "And for the love of God put those guns down!" I felt cornered in this small office, it felt like a coffin, I hated it.</p>

<p>"Don't play dumb on me!" The sheriff replied, his disdain of me only grew with each passing second. "We all heard the news from the Hunter's Corps. You set the beast free so you could escape! And for what? A pitiful disagreement over money?!"</p>

<p>"What!?" I shouted. Those treacherous snakes! "This is not what had happened! They drugged me and  beast woke and broke the restraints—"</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to believe that?" The sheriff interrupted me, "At least you're dumb enough to save us the trouble of finding you or your worthless corpse."</p>

<p>There's no way out of this, my only chance has been ruined. If I surrender, I'll die. If I shoot, I might not be fast enough and die. If I run, they'll shoot me. And even if I escape, the entire town would gun me down. Every situation will end with me dying in one way or another, might as well end it fighting, here and now.</p>

<p>My hands crept for the revolvers, the deputy seemed inexperienced, but his finger was itching to shoot, the sheriff had a cold and calculating face, he had done this before.</p>

<p>I'll have to shoot them at the same time.</p>

<p>I threw the rifle and drew the pistols, but I was sent straight to the floor before getting a chance at shooting. A man had tackled me from behind, causing me to lose hold of my guns. I kicked the man trying to reclaim them but two more men joined the attacker and they had me already pinned to the ground, twisting my arm behind my back, it felt like they would break it. I cursed them and cried.</p>

<p>"Get the Goddamn chains boy!" The sheriff barked at his deputy, his boots stomped and the chains crackled as he got closer.</p>

<p>"I WILL FUCKIN' KILL YOU!" I tried kicking the men holding me, but it went nowhere "THIS IS HOW YOU HONOR YOUR WORD YOU FAT FUCK! BETRAYIN' ME LIKE THIS! I DID WHAT I WAS TOLD! I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME! AND THIS HOW YOU REPAY ME!"</p>

<p>"You ain't doin' shit." He replied with disdain still in his voice. "The only one dyin' here is you. Hold him tightly while I cuff the bastard."</p>

<p>I tried to struggle again, trying to gather all the strength I had, but again, it all was in vain. This can't be how it ends Goddamn it! The treacherous lawman cuffed my hands behind my back and my legs too.</p>

<p>"Carry him to the cell men!" Two of them lifted me from my arms and the third from my legs. I kicked him as a desperate act of defiance, and he fell to the floor. A punch struck my face shortly. I felt disoriented, it was hard to think—or feel. </p>

<p>"Quite strugglin', you ain't achievin' anythin' with it." Said the man that punched me, I think it was him.</p>

<p>"<strong>You fucker!</strong>" The man I kicked got back on his feet and punched me hard in the stomach before carrying me. I had no power to struggle anymore, the pain was unbearable. The three of them threw me in the cell, landing on my back and hurting my cuffed hands in the process. As if the pain I'm in wasn't already enough.</p>

<p>"Thanks for your intervention, you saved us from a bloody gun fight!" The sheriff thanked the men, damn them. "And for your trouble," he opened the drawer and gave each one of them some amount of money.</p>

<p>"Only fifty each?!" One of them blurted, disappointed with the amount they got.</p>

<p>"His bounty was five-fuckin'-thousands! This is nothin'!" Another man said he was more pissed than the first. I wanted to say something to mock them but couldn't think straight, my head—and entire body—hurt. All I could do was whimper.</p>

<p>"The fool came here by himself, you didn't catch him or anythin'." The sheriff protested.</p>

<p>"But we saved your life and that deputy of yours." the first man answered, "He could've killed both of you if we didn't get involved. We deserve more."</p>

<p>The sheriff cursed under his breath as he gave them more money, they seemed satisfied and left.</p>

<p>All I could do was lie there on the cold and hard ground. I was in great pain, my head was spinning and my stomach was killing me. Breathing was hard and laborious.</p>

<p>"You can’t do this to me… She'll kill you…" I whimpered. </p>

<p>"Oh shut up." he said, "Keep an eye on him, I got an urgent message to send."</p>

<p>"Yes sir." The deputy replied.</p>

<p>And the fucker left. Leaving me on the cold floor curled up in a fetal position with my hands behind my back, and his deputy watching me, like escaping was in the realm of possibilities.</p>

<p>With what remains of my miserable life, two things loomed in my mind. My death wasn't one of them, but of two that shared the same name. I wish I could see her one last time. She could've saved me.</p>

<p>Note: This chapter concludes "Part One" of the story, and honestly, I had a lot of fun writing this fic.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about the craft and there's still much to learn. And most importantly, I enjoyed every bit of it.</p>

===CHAPTER8===
<p>The canteen used to be crowded at this hour, everyone but us had left—save for the non-hunters that worked at the Fort. Engineers, Doctors, Chemists and whatnot. We didn't know any of them well enough and Oskar wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone but me. The Marshal agreed to let me stay behind to take care of him.</p>

<p>Every available hunter and scout—including the Marshal himself—went to catch the beast that took Conner. This monster was of the highest—and only—priority to us at the moment, and now finding it became a race between the Army and the Hunters. We didn't care much if the fools got themselves killed, we only wanted to find that beast before they lost it—or killed it.</p>

<p>“Another round?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why not." He shrugged. "Not like we got anything better to do." He was all gloomy and blue for the last week or so with his arm wrapped with two sticks to support it, it looked painful—and it was. Sleep didn't come easily for my brother.</p>

<p>We already had breakfast and there was nothing else to do at the fort. Sometimes it gets boring here, especially with everyone gone now. We played for money just for laughs—and to add some stakes. We shared our money so it didn't really matter.</p>

<p>I shuffled the cards for another round, trying to do a riffle shuffle to impress him but ended up messing it up again. Instead of cards neatly overlapping over each other I lost hold and half the cards scattered all over the table.</p>

<p>Oskar smirked at me as I was collecting the cards but he didn't say anything. </p>

<p>He wanted to go on the hunt too—it was the biggest and most important hunt. And he wasn't part of it, he cursed his arm countless times because of it.</p>

<p>I didn't want to leave him alone here, he needed me and would die of worry if I went without him—but I also had a feeling that the Marshal didn't want either of us on that expedition.</p>

<p>But that wasn't what really bothered him, it was what had happened to poor Leonhard. We didn't know him as well as we wished to, but he was a good man, and a sharp leader on every expedition. We'll miss him.</p>

<p>We joined the Hunters mostly for the thrill of the hunt, and the money too—not that we're gonna admit it. Most joined from a sense of duty or revenge—not counting the ex-Gray coats. It was between joining the hunt or having their neck snapped, not much of a choice really. Most Gray coats ended up joining, the money was good and the civilized world already despised them.</p>

<p>Something lingered in my mind since that hunt and couldn’t stop thinking about it. Why did it take Conner? The beast acted rather strangely that day, it could’ve killed us all with ease. But it didn’t, it had its eyes on him once he succumbed to the drug—before breaking the chains. After getting its terrible claws on him, it retreated immediately and vanished in the woods. Never to be seen again.</p>

<p>It was something about him in particular, it can't be just to eat him—or petty revenge. It's an odd behavior and a first of its kind as far as I know. I wonder if he's still alive.</p>

<p>When I was done shuffling, I threw six cards for each one of us.</p>

<p>"Do you ever wonder why this beast is so important?" I asked my brother, I didn't bother asking about Connor, he hates talking about him. "I mean, we used to kill them but now they want us to capture them alive for whatever reason, don't you find it strange?"</p>

<p>"I do, but only the Marshal and his inner circle knows. I'm sure they have good reasons for it, but we ought to know why and for what we're riskin’ our lives for." He looked at his cards and frowned. Must be another bad hand.</p>

<p>"Do you intentionally give me bad cards?" He Accused me. Replacing one of his bad cards with a new one.</p>

<p>"You're just a bit unlucky today," I replied. The game we were playing was a modified version of Blackjack, it gained popularity in recent years. The goal was the same, to reach a total of twenty one without exceeding it. The twist was that you could use some cards to sabotage your opponent. It seems I won't have to do anything to win.</p>

<p>"Anyway," I continued, "I heard some rumors about it, they say they want to tame those beasts and use them to fight other monsters and undeads, or perhaps those bandits." I shrugged.</p>

<p>"I heard them too," He put a king on the table. I rolled my eyes and gave him my best card, an ace. I still had two tens—and a joker up my sleeve. He won't beat me. "But I highly doubt it," He went on with a shrug. "Tamin’ those things? What an absurd idea. No one is fool enough to try his luck with such beasts."</p>

<p>"Well, they might not 'tame' them in a traditional sense, rather throw them at their holdouts instead of sendin’ death squads and risk the lives of professional hunters. Maybe even inject them with an ungodly amount of drugs to make them even more vicious."</p>

<p>"Huh, that might be a good explanation, but again, that doesn't feel like the corps' style."</p>

<p>"I guess, it's just mere speculation, and also who knows what the 'corps style' is anyway. They're always secretive about this sort of shit."</p>

<p>A thoughtful look drew on his face. He wasn't thinking of the game, but about our discussion.</p>

<p>"No, it makes perfect sense," He finally let out, "Dealin' with beasts is quite simple, not easy, but simple. With the right preparation and tools, killin'—or capturin'—one is simple and predictable enough, as they have the mind of an animal." Well, as long as nothing goes wrong like last time, "But humans on the other hand... They're impossible to predict, and those bandits are gettin' smarter by the minute, their traps are gettin' more elaborate and more cunnin' and with each raid, it's gettin' harder and harder to eradicate them. They’re outlaws, no one would mourn them and the government rarely gets involved with hunters’ business, the only thing they care about is results and gettin’ shit done. So who cares if they outsourced the dangerous and hard work to the monsters?"</p>

<p>"When you put it that way... Yeah it does make sense." I replied. And with the widest shit-eating grin known to man I put the joker on the table.</p>

<p>"Goddamn it!" He blurted, and switched his hand with the two cards he put aside. Now it's time to reveal who has the greater sum, and it seemed to be me.</p>

<p>He threw his hand on the table and I placed mine. Seven against twenty. I won again, taking the last bit of money he had.</p>

<p>Oskar sighed and stood, his leg had already healed and could walk without help—although he had a slight limp here and there.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I asked with a smirk.</p>

<p>"To buy a drink." He replied.</p>

<p>"With what?"</p>

<p>"With our money?"</p>

<p>"You mean the money you just lost to me?" I said slyly, "It's all mine now."</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes, he wasn't amused.</p>

<p>"Come and sit, you'll buy your drink once you beat me."</p>

<p>"You'll buy one either way." He sat again in his chair.</p>

<p>"Only if you win."</p>

<p>"Enjoying bullying your crippled brother I see?"</p>

<p>"A little bit."</p>

<p>"Just shuffle the cards already."</p>

<p>"So eager to lose again?" I smirked.</p>

<p>He didn't reply, he was getting irritated with my teasing. I shuffled the cards and gave each one of us six cards.</p>

<p>This time my hand wasn't great, but it was doable. I wasn't planning to win this one anyway.</p>

<p>The cool air of dawn feels nice in my hair, the rustling of leaves, the gentle howls of the wind, they're soothing. The moonless sky too, and the lazy sun about to wake up soon. Dawn, so peaceful, so quite, so beautiful. I love it—Makes it easier to stalk my prey. Poor soldiers. </p>

<p><b><em>I hate it. It hurts.</em></b></p>
===CHAPTER10===
<p>The light of dawn seeped through the thick cloth. The creaking of wooden wheels, the coughs of soldiers, the chattering and their laughter, the stomping of their boots and the heavy hooves, every little sound felt like it was made just to annoy me—to mock me. It was maddening. The constant shaking on the uneven road only made the ride even the more miserable, and I could do nothing to stop it. My hands were shackled behind my back, aching my wrists, my legs too. And my head was about to explode from how tight the blindfold was, they wanted it to hurt. To make me as uncomfortable as they could get.</p>

<p>They got me. I couldn't see how many they were. A couple of men wearing army colors entered my cell at the break of light and blindfolded me—not before giving me a good beating and taking my guns away. Nothing was broken but it felt like it. Each bump of the road only amplified the pain</p>

<p>The bastards took the navy, taunted me, saying Baker would love this little piece as a trophy. I loved that gun more than life itself. It felt like I lost a part of me when they stole it.</p>

<p>I spent the better half of my life escaping and running away. I always found a way out of difficulties, either with my wits and skills—or with sheer luck alone, but it was mostly luck. But this time, there's no way out of it, no escape route and no one who would come to my rescue, it seems I ran out of luck for good this time. A miracle is the only hope I got, and I don't think it's happening anytime soon.</p>

<p>Resting my head against the cold and rusty bars, but I wasn't alone in my imprisonment, a soldier was trailing next to the prison wagon. Of course I couldn't see him but I felt someone was walking next to me. Closer than the others.</p>

<p>"How did you do it?" The soldier finally asked, his voice was young and soft-spoken. Unlike the others, there was no distaste in his tone, rather asking from genuine curiosity.</p>

<p>"Do what?" I replied, my head ached badly and I wasn't in the mood for talking—or anything for that matter. All I wanted was an end for all my misery.</p>

<p>"You know, survive all by yourself in the woods." I could hear him getting slightly closer, "And with a monster and the army on your back, how did you do it?"</p>

<p>"A mix of luck and skills I suppose." I shrugged. But it was mostly luck—and that monster. She was a monster, she looked like a monster, acted like a monster, everyone called her a monster, even me when I first saw her. But… I didn't like this label, after what we went through, she felt more than just a monster, she was a human soul—at least to me she was.</p>

<p>"Did you kill it?" He asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The monster, did you kill it?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't." I omitted mentioning anything about her, she's an odd one and I doubt anyone would believe there's such a thing as a 'friendly monster'—besides they might take it the wrong way. "I just ran and ran until my legs couldn't carry me any longer, and when I looked back I found that I just, well, lost it."</p>

<p>"I see, any sane man would do the same, only a fool would try to kill monsters on his own." He replied, "How was it? What did that thing look like?" He seemed really curious about it.</p>

<p>"It was a creature of nightmares, straight from the deepest pit of hell." I told him, "Pray you never lay eyes on somethin' as horrible as that monster. The thing had a horrible skull for a head that always grinnin' a sinister grin, always stained with the blood of its prey—or victims. Long claws that could cut a man in half, this monster was probably twice or thrice the size of a man." And she had beautiful eyes. Despite the scary looks—There was a cutesy quality to her that was only visible to me, her pet-like oddities and odd fondness towards me made me grew fond of her and and like her in return. It felt wrong...</p>

<p>"How did you end up like this,<em> Connor?"</em></p>

<p>"Stop talkin' with the prisoner back there!" A rasping voice barked at the soldier keeping me company, it must've been their officer.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but do I know you?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"No," he replied in whispers, not wanting his officer to hear. The other soldiers didn't seem to care that much—or at least from the sound of it. "Nor do I," He went on, "But one day a distressed lookin' rider came out of nowhere with a kid to my town on a horse that was on the verge of dyin', and the man threw the kid without sayin' a word then left like the wind, never to be seen again. That would raise some questions, especially with wanted posters of said man blasted everywhere accusin' him of murderin' an officer and alongside ten other soldiers. What is your deal exactly, Connor?"</p>

<p>"The kid! What happened to him!?" I blurted loudly, and the officer barked at me to shut the fuck up, threatening to come and personally break my jaw.</p>

<p>"Oh he's alright," He replied in a hushed voice, "He's workin' at the China man's General Store, the kid seems angry and troubled all the time, rarely talks to anyone aside from his one friend, but he's doin' good, I think. It's been awhile since the last time I was there." It was reassuring that my efforts—and their sacrifice weren't in vain.</p>

<p>"So what happened?" The soldier continued, lowering his voice even more, hearing that it was already hard enough, "You killed an officer—Baker's brother of all people—then came to my town with a kid?" He drew nearer my cage and whispered, "What really happened that day?"</p>

<p>"It's a long story," And I hated talking—and thinking about it, but someone has to listen to my side, I sighed. "But to make it short, the guerrillas had a kid with them, Ahab wanted him executed with the rest of the rebels, and I refused to hand him the kid and, well, one thing led to another and I shot him and escaped with the kid. I think you know the rest of the story. And half of the ten soldiers I supposedly murdered were my friends who came to my defense." I missed them—and I'm going to meet them soon.</p>

<p>"I see… That makes more sense than the story they spread. And what about the huntin' business? Did they lie about it too?"</p>

<p>"They did." I answered, and they were the ones to put me through this hell, "They drugged me the second we caught the beast and were plannin' to sell me from the get go, but the beast somehow broke its restraints and dragged me to its lair while I was unconscious. For some reason it didn't eat me right away and when I woke up I found myself in a dark cave filled with human remains and half eaten carcasses."</p>

<p>"Jesus…"</p>

<p>"And after that I just ran and ran till I reached valentine, I thought I was pardoned and the sheriff had promised that he would help me escape, and here I am, in a cage, beaten and blindfolded and on the way to meet my demise."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it had to end like this."</p>

<p>"Don't be." The last thing I wanted was someone's pity. The great release of death was all I wanted now.</p>

<p>"No, you don't understand." He said, "I'll be one of the men who'll shoot you, I'm sorry it had to be like this. Truly."</p>

<p>I sighed. "Again. Don't be." And he went silent, he had nothing to say and I didn't want to hear him apologize for something he had no say in. It didn't matter who I got shot by, I'll forget it before I hit the ground.</p>

<p>In all honesty, I wasn't expecting to end like this—or to end at all. One would have the notion he would live forever, that nothing could kill him, and go on with his days like he's immortal as if death is not inevitable. But every soul would taste death one day or another, every man is condemned to die but his execution and time is unknown—but my doom was certain, both in time and method. Nothing and no-one could save me. I didn't feel anything but desolation and shame, no fear, no hate. Just an empty abyss that ate my soul. When I die, no one will remember or mourn me. I've lost.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I even deserve to be remembered or tears shed on my grave. The only people that cared about me had died and the only living one probably hates me. The only thing that cared about me was a Daemon I somehow managed to hurt its feelings. It's quite an achievement. Everyone would remember me as a villain. Even Lillian—both of them.</p>

<p>"Do you uh…" He finally broke the silence, "Have any last messages you want to send? To your family or loved ones." He's a kind man, if only the world had more men like him. "Baker hates your guts and probably won't give you this privilege, I could deliver it for you. Consider it uh… an apology for shooting you, I suppose." </p>

<p>"Don't think about it too much, you might end up with the wax bullet." I paused for a moment, "What's your name?" I asked upon realizing I didn't know his name.</p>

<p>"Micah, Micah Vickers."</p>

<p>I straightened my posture to think of my last message, "Pleasure meetin' you Micah." I said to him, "I do have a message and I trust you to deliver it"</p>

<p>I heard the rustling of papers, he hastily took his journal out of his pocket to write down whatever I got to say. "You have my word."</p>

<p>"What is today's date?" I asked, I wasn't sure but it felt like we're nearing the end of October judging from how cold it could get sometimes.</p>

<p>"October's Twenty-eighth." He answered. Halloween at the doors—her birthday too.</p>

<p>I used to envy Lillian for being born on Halloween, it was the most fun day of the year and she got to celebrate her birthday during it too. We would spend the whole day messing around and laughing—as if that wasn't what we always did as kids—and eating cakes and pies, and in the evening when we were too tired we would all gather around the fire and share scary stories in the night. Ghouls, ghosts, vampires, werewolves and whatnot. They frightened us—but I loved them.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, I'm living inside one of those scary stories. And like how I used to be fond of them despite scaring me, I liked that monster despite fearing her.</p>

<p>"To my dearest Lillian," I finally said after considerable thinking, hearing faint scratches of pencil on paper, but the sounds of horses and boots overpowered them.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I couldn't be with you on your birthday this year, or the years that went by for that matter." I gave him some time before continuing. "Unfortunately I won't be able to see ever again."</p>

<p>"Don't bother writin' back to me, as I'm already dead once this letter reaches you. I'll be executed soon."</p>

<p>"Executed soon." He murmured to himself as he wrote, "Go on." He didn't have to repeat that part.</p>

<p>"A kind soldier is helpin' me write this letter to you as I'm bein' carried to my demise. His name is Micah, he's been one of the few kind souls to me in this unkind earth." But that wasn't entirely true, the monster that shared her name was kind to me too—but only me. <em>Only me. </em></p>

<p>"Even in my last moments, the only thing I could think of is you. And as much as it pains me that I can't be in your arms right now. I hope you understand that I have always, and will always love you."</p>

<p>"I know you're wonderin' where I have been all these years, but I can't explain in detail. But I want you to know whatever you heard about me, they all were lies, you know me. You know my nature. I spent my days in the wilderness thinkin' about you and only you. My only wish is that you forgive me for desertin' you."</p>

<p>"I killed that officer to save a kid, so he could have a chance in life at the cost of mine. And when they finally got me, they had me do some work for the hunters in exchange for my freedom. The hunters betrayed me for the bounty on my head and now the army got me. They'll finally put me to rest. And I would soon be reunited with mother."</p>

<p>"Please don't cry when I'm gone. And please…" I paused for a moment, "Please don't hate me... Because I'll hate myself if you do." Saying this out loud is somewhat embarrassing, there were some chuckles and snorting but I didn't care, I would die soon anyway.</p>

<p>"The thing is, I already do. I can't take it anymore. I have no strength left in me to go any further. I missed you dearly and my only wish is to see you one last time, to see your beautiful eyes and melt in your embrace."</p>

<p>"I promised that we would get married once I return. This promise haunts me—it kills me and makes my soul bleed, I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Yours faithfully, Connor." I concluded my letter. If I had more time—and less noise to think straight—I would've written a better letter and explained everything thoroughly to her, but I had to work with what I had, like always.</p>

<p>"Lillian, such a lovely name," Micah finally said, "Where does your girl live?"</p>

<p>"Hazelwood, it's a small town in eastern Missouri, near the Illinois' line."</p>

<p>"Hazelwood, eastern Missouri, near Illinois. Got it." He wrote that down before closing his journal.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Micah." He was a stranger but he was willing to hear a dead-man and offered to carry his last request. He did more to me than anyone and he wasn't expecting anything in return.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it. It's the least I could do." He replied, "I promise I'll personally deliver your last words to your love."</p>

<p>I rested my head against the uncomfortable steel and tried to sleep. I felt ready to die. I did more than I could and it wasn't enough. I hope I could have one last pleasant dream—before a bullet pierces my heart.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>"THE FUCK WAS THAT!?" A soldier shouted as another screamed in the back, his cries immediately disappeared the second they were out. I didn't even get the chance to fade to blissful sleep.</p>

<p>The wagon suddenly stopped and my head hit the bars. Boots stomping violently, soldiers running and throwing themselves behind cover, bolts yanked and guns chambered. They were all on edge, too busy to give a damn about the caged man.</p>

<p>And silence loomed over us. Only the gentle howls of wind assured me I didn't go deaf.</p>

<p>"The hell is goin' on?!" I shouted, but no one answered, "Do you hear me?! What is goin' on?! Have we been attacked?—" </p>

<p>"WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP FOR A MINUTE!" A man barked at me. His voice cracked mid sentence, he was scared and on edge. Everyone was.</p>

<p>The deafening silence once again.</p>

<p>"SHOOT THE DAMN THING!" A soldier shrieked, taking it as their order, everyone unleashed a volley of lead at whatever it was, filling the air with the scent of burnt powder.</p>

<p>Could it be? Could that be her? She came back for me—or to get her revenge on me… for abandoning her…</p>

<p>A distinctive howl that I wished I didn't know, like a thousand wailing women and a pack of wolves. It was her, it was unmistakably her. And her roars were angry, only blood would quench her blood-lust—and there's no escape from it.</p>

<p>The soldiers cycled their rifles and released another volley all at once—my ears rang the sheer volume of fire.</p>

<p>"GET ME OUT OF HERE! THIS THING WOULD KILL US ALL!" But no one answered my cries.</p>

<p>A soldier screamed but it quickly turned into gurgling on blood. Gunfire and shrieks of men who never knew fear before filled the air.</p>

<p>"KILL IT! KILL IT!" A gruff voice barked at the troops, it was the officer—I think it was him. He wasn't even able to hide his fear.</p>

<p>The nightmarish sounds of terrified screams, flesh tearing and bones breaking—The sounds I came to associate with her. The sounds that never left me and made me fear her. She's here—and I'm next on the killing floor.</p>

<p>Their officer let out a terrified shriek as he called for his mother as his last words—the smell of blood mixed with burnt powder overpowered my senses, painting a horrible picture of what was happening around me.</p>

<p>"TO HELL WITH THIS!" A soldier cried, his voice trembling and shaking from the terror, and he ran in the opposite direction of death and carnage, more boots followed his lead.</p>

<p>"WHERE THE FUCK YOU'RE GOING! DON'T LEAVE ME!" A familiar voice cried, it was Micah, and his comrades had abandoned him, leaving him alone against her. Leaving him for dead.</p>

<p>"Stay away!" He cried, firing a desperate shot. Which only made her madder, growling and snarling at the man.</p>

<p>"STOP!" I cried with the faint hope she would listen to me, I didn't want him to die, not like this.</p>

<p>He yanked the bolt loudly and hastily for another shot, only to be met with the click of an empty chamber.</p>

<p>He screamed at the monster trying—and failing—to keep it away. He begged and called for God and everyone—anyone—to save him. But no one answered.</p>

<p>"Stop! For fuck's sake stop! Not him! For my sake don't kill him!" I pleaded for his life, but it didn't stop.</p>

<p>His screams only became more frantic, begging it to stop till his voice gave and couldn't do it anymore, she caught him, and was about to kill him!—tear him!—Eat him!</p>

<p>"LILLIAN!" I shouted like it was my life on the line, "DON'T KILL HIM! PLEASE." I heard a thud hitting the ground, but no sounds of death. "Please, Lillian. I beg you… don't kill him for my sake don't kill him. If I still mean anything to you… Don't kill him… Please…" I begged and begged. If I could save one life… save his life.</p>

<p>Laborious breathing crept towards my cage, it sounded tired and in great discomfort. And with tremendous effort, the cage's door was yanked open, breaking the lock in the process. Sharp and wet claws got hold of me—but they were gentle... Despite how tired she was, she handled me with great care, not wanting to hurt me.</p>

<p>"Connor" She exhaled, "Found you." her voice was shaky and exhausted. It sounded like she was desperate to find me...</p>

<p>And the fabric was removed off my face—to witness her work, I wished it had stayed.</p>

<p>The road had turned into a dark mixture of mud and crimson, blood ran like rivers in the wheel's prints, and the soldiers, the soldiers—or what was left of them—were reduced to piles of meat torn beyond recognition, broken bones—crushed skulls, severed hands still clinging on their rifles. Blood still leaking from the fresh bodies, there was no hint of blue left in their uniforms.</p>

<p>It was a massacre, and the perpetrator was standing before me, holding me in its claws.</p>

<p>She was wild-eyed with her boney ivory stained with the blood of her victims, over a dozen wounds of various calibers decorated her body, oozing the dark blood. On her arms, on her chest, on her abdomen. And worst of all, a sword plunged deep in her neck—with the blade sticking out through the back of her neck, dripping the dark blood. She was in great pain.</p>

<p>Micah was on the ground across of me, shaking and trembling from the terror and madness that just unfolded upon him. As pale as a corpse, but he looked as young and friendly as his voice. Dark short hair and a youthful face that lacked any facial hair to give the soldiery look. He didn't look like he belonged in the army, too young and still full of life for this profession.</p>

<p>She went for the chains and tried to remove them but couldn't—or at least without hurting me.</p>

<p>"The key. He has them." I told her, eyeing the frightened soldier. She gazed at the poor man, he was both terrified and confused. "Please, don't hurt him." She seemed puzzled with my request.</p>

<p>She put me gently and crept back to Micah, he crawled on his back, desperately—and vainly—trying to get away from the monster. But she was already on top of him.</p>

<p>"The keys." She exhaled.</p>

<p>"What?!" Was the only word he could conjure.</p>

<p>"The keys." She repeated but this time it sounded more like a snarl.</p>

<p>"I—I ddon't have them." He blurted, "The—The officer does." He could barely speak—barely holding it together.</p>

<p>"Get them." She commanded, moving away from him. But fear had paralyzed him.</p>

<p>"Get them." She grew angrier and more wolfish, her patience was running low.</p>

<p>He stood upon her commands and almost fell again, after witnessing this madness. All the death and blood. The talking monster and its odd mannerism. His legs couldn't carry his weight. But he forced them to. He hurried towards a corpse that was missing its upper half—only it spilled guts and legs remains of what was human, it had a swordless scabbard on its hip, he was the one to stab her. Something inside me wanted to hate him for hurting her, for putting her in this pain. But I couldn't do it, he was barely a man anymore—barely human. He was defending himself and his men against horrors beyond them. They deserved better…</p>

<p>He snatched the keys from his fallen officer and scurried towards me, almost slipping on the blood and viscera of his unrecognizable comrades. He regained his footing and knelt behind me to unlock the cuffs. Inserting the key proved difficult for him, his hands shaking against his will and no matter how hard he tried they refused to stop.</p>

<p>"The hell is that thing." He exhaled in my ear, "No monsters are supposed to be in these areas!", gone his soft voice, now replaced by a raspy and raw voice from all the screaming. It was the only thing he said, but I knew there were more questions lingering on his tongue. Why is <em>that</em> monster here? Why did it kill everyone but stopped at <em>me</em>? And why did it <em>listen to me</em>? And why does it know <em>my name</em>? Why did I call it <em>that name</em>?—And I didn't know why, it came automatically in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>And there she was, towering ominously over us. Observing the soldier as he unshackled me, she was in pain, I could feel it, and I hated it. I still had some of that drug in my satchel. She needs it.</p>

<p>I felt him sliding something cold and wet in my hand before twisting the key. A gun, did he have it on him or snatched a corpse without me noticing?</p>

<p>"I don't know the hell is goin' on but we'll run," He whispered, "We'll shoot and run, you did it before, we can do it again."</p>

<p>"I didn't," I murmured. Feeling the iron in my hand. Shooting her… a thought that never crossed my mind.</p>

<p>"What?" He removed the shackles of my arms and legs—now I was free. But I let go of the gun and massaged my aching wrist. He looked at me with only confusion, like some just betrayed, and from his eyes, it looked and felt like that.</p>

<p>"I didn't run, it—the monster helped me." I said as I stood and walked toward her, she was in pain—and it pained me too. My arm automatically extended to comfort her but she hesitantly withdrew, "It's alright." I softly told her before trying to touch her again. But a click of a hammer stopped me. When I turned around I saw Micah pointing his pistol at me—his hand still shaking.</p>

<p>She growled like a hound defending its master, I didn't know if it was an attempt to scare him or of genuine desire to kill. </p>

<p>"You did set it free." He accused with his harsh voice. "What else did you lie about?" Forcing each word out.</p>

<p>"I only told you the truth!" I defended myself. Only part of the truth. </p>

<p>He furrowed his brows, "Only the truth! The thing standin' in front of me tells a different tale!—" He let out a violent cough, shouting was painful to him, "You did not only set the thing free, you conspired with the damn thing! I should gun you down for this!"</p>

<p>Her snarl only grew louder with his threat. Trying to stop her from leaping to kill him, but I didn't know if I could hold her if she truly wanted him dead.</p>

<p>"You didn't only betray your oath to the army! You betrayed us all! You betrayed the entirety of mankind!" He said, eyeing and pointing the gun at her, his eyes were filled with a mixture of fear and hate.</p>

<p>"Micah, I'm the only thing standing between you and her—"</p>

<p>"HER!?" He blurted, "I thought I heard you wrong but you did name the damn thing after your girl—"</p>

<p>"If you shoot me nothin' would stop her from killin' you!" I raised my voice trying to stop him from doin' somethin' both of us would regret, "Please Micah, don't make it end that way."</p>

<p>"This is not right," He said, pointing the gun at me dreading to shoot, "This is not right. You should die." He threw the keys after a long consideration and backed off. "I should've killed you right where you stand." He kept walking backward, not taking the gun off me—and her, with each step he took she wanted to lunge at him, she wanted him dead—she would've if I wasn't here to stop her. Once he reached the edge of the road, he turned and ran as fast as humanly possible to the woods and disappeared.</p>

<p>She was about to chase him but I stopped her, "He's gone. It's alright." I told her</p>

<p>"But he wanted you dead. Wanted to kill you."</p>

<p>"But he didn't." Thank God he had some sense in him.</p>

<p>I took a closer look at her, Poor thing—poor girl, she had been shot at least twenty times. And that sword… She was in great pain and it's because of me, she hurled herself in death's way just to save me, even after I had abandoned her… When the entire world had betrayed me, she came back...</p>

<p>"It hurts." She exhaled tiredly, shaking from the pain. It was half wolf's whimper and half a woman's cry.</p>

<p>"It's alright," I tried to comfort her, but it did very little to ease the pain, "I have somethin' that would help." </p>

<p>I took the keys and went for the prisoner wagon—and she followed with a painful limp. They locked my belongings—including my prized gun—in a chest next to the driver. But what I really wanted now was the drug. It probably had enough for a dose for me, but I'm not sure if it would be enough for her. She's bigger and in greater pain than I ever had before, but it ought to help.</p>

<p>I walked past a headless corpse—its crushed head wasn't far from it, its brain was splattered everywhere and its eyes half buried in the mud. It cold hands clinging to a broken shotgun, it seems I won't be using it anymore. Trying to ignore the grotesque sight I climbed the wagon and went straight for the chest and opened it.</p>

<p>And my gears were calling my name, the gun belt, the two new armies, my satchel—and next to it a medical bag, thank God—and the navy in all its glory. I quickly tucked it in my belt and began rummaging through my satchel for the medicine bottle. It was already more than half empty, but it would be enough to dull her pain, I hoped. I took the bandages and alcohol from the bag and went back to her. There was a bottle of regular morphine there too, I might be needing it later.</p>

<p>She sat all miserable, shaking from her wounds and whimpering to herself. "Open your mouth." I told her softly. Her oversized claws seemed only good for tearing and slashing, holding things? Not so much. </p>

<p>She opened her maw—and a hurt moan escaped. Giving a better look at her inner—more human mouth. It lacked any skin and was just a row of regular yellow—and blood stained—human teeth, her whole mouth was bloodied, and her breath was foul, reeking of rust and death. I held my breath and tilted her head slightly upward with my free hand—not too much as to prevent the blade from causing any more damage. I poured the drug in her mouth, making sure she drank it all and not a single drop was gone to waste.</p>

<p>"Do you feel it?" I asked, waiting a few moments to see if it had any effects on her.</p>

<p>She nodded lightly, "A little." She replied. At least it's better than nothing.</p>

<p>"Let me help you," I said softly as I soaked the bandages in alcohol and reached for the sword, but she pulled away.</p>

<p>"It hurts." She whimpered.</p>

<p>I sighed, "I know," She was like a beaten dog shaking and whimpering uncontrollably, for a second it almost made me forget she's a man-eating monster, but that thought didn't bother me. I just wanted to help my one and only companion, "But I have to remove it." I told her, reaching again for the hilt, this time she didn't pull away.</p>

<p>But I was afraid to pull it, probably more than her. I was afraid of hurting her more—or accidentally killing her…</p>

<p>I had to be fast and confident, hesitation would cause a fatal mistake and I can't afford any errors. I took a deep breath and pulled the thing with a swift and steady hand—making sure not to cause any more damage. Dropping the blade on the ground.</p>

<p>She whimpered and inhaled in pain, the dark blood oozed from the open wound. I took the soaked bandages and wrapped her wounded neck, she again inhaled as the alcohol stung her—and I did too for some reason.</p>

<p>"It hurt." She exhaled as the white quickly turned into dark red.</p>

<p>"I know," Was the only thing I could say to her. "But it will be alright, I promise."</p>

<p>It was a miracle the sword didn't puncture her windpipe or sever a major artery. After finishing with her I went to pick the rest of my gear—and my hat from the wagon. I wore my satchel and buckled the belt, placing each gun in its holster. I took a rifle of a dead soldier, and his ammunition too, he won't be needing them anyway. I was about to leave but the swordless scabbard caught my attention. After thinking about it for a short moment I crouched and removed the sheath of the half-officer and attached it to my belt.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" She asked, tilting her head but not like she used to.</p>

<p>"Want to get something," I told her, "It won't take long." I took the sword from where I dropped it and whipped the blood and mud off before putting it back in the sheath.</p>

<p>"You took the sword." Her voice had a faint snarl in it.</p>

<p>"It's alright, it won't hurt you. I won't let anyone or anythin' hurt you," I told her, touching her lightly. It helped to calm her. "Let's go, We need to leave this place and find somewhere to lay low."</p>

<p>She nodded and followed me to the woods. We had to get as far as possible from this massacre, one of the survivors would definitely inform the army what had happened, and Micah… He had seen too much, and knows everything. Maybe I shouldn't have let him go… No, it was the right call, too many had died today. And He should be among the living.</p>

<p>She limped slowly as I tried to help her walk. It was a horrible day for the both of us—her more than me.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>We walked for what felt like hours and as far as we could from the massacre, she was limping with each step of the way, her pace only got slower and slower as time went on, she couldn't go any further—but thankfully we found a rock shelter to hide in, it was small and not that deep, but deep enough no one could see us from the outside and some bushes helped to conceal it slightly. Helping her in, she immediately collapsed the moment she stepped in.</p>

<p>My heart sank and I dropped to my knees to check on her, please don't die, not now... not on me… please.</p>

<p>She was breathing, slowly. Thank God. Her eyes were still open, she's still alive but clearly tired—and in agony. </p>

<p>"How you're feelin' now?" I gave her a reassuring touch.</p>

<p>"It hurts. Tired. I want to sleep."</p>

<p>"Does it still hurt like before?"</p>

<p>"Less. But hurts."</p>

<p>I petted her softly, trying to ease the pain and comfort her. At least the drug was working on her. But it wasn't done yet. I took my knife out, "This would hurt but… I have to do it."</p>

<p>She whimpered, "No… Please No…" She was in great pain and discomfort. She didn't want me to dig the bullets out.</p>

<p>"I know," I petted her again and she lifted her head to look at me, and her eyes were screaming, "I don't want to hurt you or see you in pain, but I have to do it." All her pain, I could feel it in me, those pleading eyes, asking for this agony to end. She wasn't just an animal or a mindless monster, there was a person—a girl trapped deep in this hellish thing, and she was fighting to save what little humanity she had. And it kills me. "It will be alright. I promise." She lowered and rested her head on the hard floor, and I began the surgery.</p>

<p>With each stab, with each stroke, with each bullet removed she whimpered and cried, sometimes it sounded like a dog, others it sounded like a girl in pain. And it wasn't ending anytime soon. It felt like I was stabbing my soul, I hated that I was hurting her, but I can't stop now.</p>

<p>The splashing of blood only made it harder to get a firm grip on the knife or the deformed bullets but I managed it.</p>

<p>With a final stroke I took the last bullet and threw it next to the other, letting out a sigh of relief, it had finally ended. I removed them all—some proved harder than others, but I did it. My fingers and wrist ached to the point I couldn't move them anymore. "It's done." I told her, putting the knife away, but she didn't respond. For a moment I feared she might've died on me, but there was a subtle breathing movement. Thank God. She either lost consciousness or sleep had somehow came to her. Either way she's alive.</p>

<p>I collapsed against the rocky walls. I just noticed the orange lights creeping through the entrance. How long has it been? I was so consumed with her I lost track of time—and surroundings. Both my hands were covered in her sticky blood. My clothes too, and I was exhausted.</p>

<p>I had removed more than twenty bullets from her. Poor girl, she earned the rest. I didn't have anything to cover her wounds with—but I don't think she needs it, she heals hellishly fast and the drugs quickens the healing too.</p>

<p>I sat next to her and hugged the rifle, watching the golden sunset turn into dusk, then the darkness of the night. My eyes begged me to sleep, but I had to guard her.</p>

<p>Despite her frightening me, despite her being a wild thing. I cared about her, I truly did. She was the only one that harbored anything resampling love towards me. And I don't fear her anymore.</p>

<p>My hands crept to hers, feeling the soft—and blooded claws. It didn't feel right, but I still liked her, I felt connected to her somehow, like how she feels connected to me.</p>

<p>Micah's words echoed in my mind, <em>'It's not right, I should die.'</em> The thing is, he's not wrong. </p>

<p>Whoever she was, she was a kind soul—and in some way—she still is.</p>

<p>I didn't dare sleep while she's in this state. It felt like someone might come any moment to kill us. Letting Micah go was a liability, at best they might not believe him and dismiss him as imagining things or going mad, but at worse… he might've informed the army not that I was only still alive, but also conspiring with beasts. They could be on our track right now with a group of soldiers looking for a runaway and his beast…</p>

<p>The only thought wandering around in my head was Lillian and that letter residing in Micah's journal, would he still deliver it like he promised? Or after what he saw… Would he tell her… Would she hate me if she knew... I just hope he leaves us alone. I don't want him to die by her hands—or mine.</p>

<p>The night was long and exhausting, only my thoughts kept me company—and it was tortuous. The sun eventually crept and dawn cascaded through the entrance. My eyelids were heavy and I was wrestling with sleep. Something shifted next to me, and when I looked it was my beast stretching lightly, shifting to a more comfortable sleeping position and made a faint whimper that sounded more like a yawn.</p>

<p>"Feelin' any better?" I asked with a tired smile. I was happy she was still alive and it seems her pain had dulled.</p>

<p>She looked at me with sleepy eyes but didn't respond. After a long moment of staring she snatched me into a sleeping embrace.</p>

<p>"Wait!" I protested, "I need to stay on the look out—"</p>

<p>"Sleep." She cut me short. I tried to free myself from the furry prison only to be met with her tightening her embrace.</p>

<p>"Sleep." She exhaled softly. Her feminine voice had a soothing effect on me.</p>

<p>I tried to free myself again but I was too tired—feeling the soft fur on my face and her warmth only made her command the more appealing. I gave up and yielded to her wishes. All I could do was close my eyes and rest as she nuzzled my head. The world didn't seem to matter anymore. </p>

<p>I'm glad she's back. I missed her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>
===CHAPTER11===
<p>Wolves picked up on the scent of blood in our shelter, but they didn't sound like wolves, it was something bigger—more vicious. But as soon as they heard her howls they scurried away in a heartbeat. It was a meek howl—and she went back to sleep immediately after letting it out—it wasn't like the roaring ones she used to make, but it was enough to scare them away, never to be seen or heard again.</p>

<p>They might've been <em>Hellhounds</em>, I heard about them—undead dogs and wolves, but unlike their human counterpart, they were anything but sluggish and dump, preferring to hunt in packs and still as cunning as they were in living—this curse sharpened their senses and wit. I had never seen one in person before and I hope I don't have to find out if half of what I heard was true. But if they were hellhounds, that means those abominations started creeping outside the afflicted zones… Makes one wonder the effectiveness of the hunters combating this plague.</p>

<p>A squeeze of the trigger and a bullet obliterating the snake's skull—curling in the mud as life escaped, adding it to the other two I managed to catch this morning—there were no animals here, nothing to catch and nothing to eat.</p>

<p>Holstering the pistol, I stepped in the mud to retrieve this pitiful breakfast, thankfully it had rained yesterday and I was able to collect some rainwater. I didn't know how much longer a single canteen could sustain us for. I didn't like the idea of leaving her for long periods looking for water, I feared someone—or something might come and harm her while I was gone.</p>

<p>It had been three days since she broke me out, and she was still too tired to walk. I took care of her the best I could—but all I could was just provide her with comfort and bring her food, but the food wasn't enough and the comforting didn't help much.</p>

<p>On the first day I gave her some morphine to dull the pain and she was out for the whole day, didn't eat nor drink. In the second, she opened her eyes and managed to eat—but very little. And today I left while she was asleep.</p>

<p>Three days… Today is the last day of October… Lillian's birthday... She would turn twenty five this year—another year I spent away from her… I cursed myself for it. I should be with her now, not here collecting snakes in the damn mud—but she needs me.</p>

<p>Carrying the snakes and heading back to the humble cave, it should be enough to lighten her hunger. She must be starving by now—I was starving. I couldn't focus properly and my movement turned slow and sluggish with hunger. I was so lucky I managed to catch those snakes with the first shot.</p>

<p>Dragging myself to our cramped shelter, the road back was uneventful, just trees, more trees and even more trees. The only noteworthy thing about them was a tree or two that had oddly shaped and dark mushrooms growing on them—they looked like they were bleeding with dark crimson oozing out of them, the sight alone was poisonous.</p>

<p>When I got in I was greeted by the scent of iron, but I grew used to it—like how I grew used to this wolf. I found her still sleeping like how I left her: Laying on her belly with her skull resting on her claws—her body still covered with bullet wounds. </p>

<p>The cave was so compressed that I had to squeeze myself in to sit next to her, but not too small it felt oppressive or uncomfortable. Some daylight sneaked in but it was nigh impossible to see the outlaw and his partner in crime.</p>

<p>I had no way of probably treating her wounds, they looked nasty and swollen, but thankfully there were no signs of infections, most of her wounds began healing and the bleeding had stopped—which seemed to exhaust her energy greatly. She was tired and sleepy all the time.</p>

<p>I put the breakfast aside and went to check on the sleepy wolf, gently petting her head. Her ears twitched for short moments before lazily opening her eyes to see what was distributing her blissful slumber.</p>

<p>"Wake up," I said with a gentle touch, "I brought you some food." She lifted her head and let out a big yawn, "Do you still feel any pain?" She didn't respond but I could see it in her eyes. "It's gonna be alright." I told her before going back to the snakes.</p>

<p>Removing the deformed heads and gutting and skinning each one—adding more blood to the dried blood of yesterday and the day before, once I was done, I cut the first snake into bite size pieces.</p>

<p>"Come on, open your mouth." I told her. She opened her boney maw and I put a piece in the human mouth, she chewed slowly on the meat and crunched the bone then swallowed. And I fed her another piece, and another and another till I was out of meat. </p>

<p>I took the second snake and fed her again. All the fear I originally harbored for her had disappeared and replaced by sadness, her current state pained me and made my soul bleed. However when I was about to feed her the third she refused to open her mouth.</p>

<p>"You must eat." I told her softly, trying to get her to open her mouth.</p>

<p>"No," She exhaled, "You eat."</p>

<p>"I'm not hungry," I lied, "You're bigger and need to eat to regain your strength." But she refused to open her mouth.</p>

<p>I sighed, "Please." I petted her gently with my free hand. "I know you're still hungry, eat for me, please..." But she didn't budge.</p>

<p>I continued petting her for a long moment, hearing her slow heartbeat, her lazy breathing, "Please." I told her again. But she refused.</p>

<p>I sighed in defeat, staying with her for one moment longer before leaving the cramped cave looking to make a small fire. She was as stubborn as a mule, there was no way I could convince her—or force her to eat. She really cares...</p>

<p>Outside, gathering what little left of dry twigs and leaves into a small pile, I struck a match from what little I had and they were ablaze, I blew on the fire till it grew enough for a humble grill. Skewering the snake meat onto a straightish stick I found, I held the meat over the small fire, waiting for it to cook. </p>

<p>I kept an eye on anything that might be creeping around, behind the trees and bushes—anything might be on the lookout for us, anything that wanted to hurt us. There was no sign of soldiers, it seems they forgot about me—or presumed me dead. Those cowards abandoned their comrade when he needed them most, they wish they had been half the soldier I was.</p>

<p>The snake started to develop a nice roast to it and the smell only made me the hungrier. I couldn't find anything to hunt in these damn woods, not a single buck or anything larger than rats and snakes, those hellhounds must've killed or scared the wildlife here. </p>

<p>I took the snake off the fire once it looked done and bit into it, it looked like chicken meat, well, a snake shaped chicken—It tasted like chicken too, kind of, more like a mix of chicken and fish. It tasted good nonetheless. But it wasn't enough to satisfy my stomach—and two were or even three were nowhere near enough for her.</p>

<p>My mind wandered as I picked on the meat, Micah knew the truth, or part of it. <em>I've been conspiring with beasts</em>, as he puts it, labeling me a traitor of mankind. I wonder if he reported me—or simply went with his fellow soldiers and said I was dead. I wish everyone thought I'm dead and left me alone.</p>

<p>Would he still deliver my letter after what he saw?—Would he tell her what he saw?</p>

<p>I ate as my thoughts ravaged my mind, life has been unkind to me in the past half decade. And it doesn't seem like it would end anytime soon.</p>

<p>"Connor." A soft and tired voice called, snapping me out of this depressing state. "Come… Please." It sounded like a plea. I ate the last bit of meat and went to check on my wolf.</p>

<p>"Somethin' wrong?" I asked as I entered the shelter, my features couldn't hide my worries.</p>

<p>"Stay with me." She said softly. "Please…"</p>

<p>I sighed and sat next to her, stroking her hair, it seemed to always help and soothe her. "How are you feelin'? Better than yesterday?"</p>

<p>She nodded, "Tired, but can't sleep."</p>

<p>"It's alright." Playing with her hair and petting her gently, her tail swung lazily with each stroke. I continued with this ordeal for long minutes. She kept looking at me when I wasn't looking, retreating her eyes away immediately when I looked down. She didn't say a word, but I could tell something was bothering her since yesterday.</p>

<p>"Connor..." She said sheepishly after a long minute. </p>

<p>"Yes." I said, scratching behind her ear.</p>

<p>"Do you fear me?" She finally asked, avoiding my eyes. "Do you... hate me?..."</p>

<p>"No, I don't" I answered, "When we first met… you used to frighten me, but now it all disappeared." She became a fact of my life now, but something inside me was screaming, this thing—this beast I'm playing with its hair, helping comforting and taking care of is still a monster who didn't discriminate on what she hunted or whom she killed. But I couldn't bring myself to hate or even fear her.</p>

<p>It was what she wanted to hear, but I wasn't sure if she believed it truly. </p>

<p>"When you came back for me… I was afraid that I might lose you that day." I went on, if anyone had heard me saying this they would have called me a mad man—and rightfully so. I might be mad, but it doesn't matter anymore. "Everyone that ever cared about me is either dead or I've abandoned them. When I was in the army… I had some friends—dear friends. We loved each other like we were brothers. One night when we were drinkin’ we said we would kill and die for each other if the whole world came crashing on one of us, of course we were jokin' and never expected it to happen for real. But they weren't jokin', and had to prove it the hard—ugly way."</p>

<p>She looked up to me, her eyes sparked with curiosity, "Tell me about your friends." She asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>I couldn't refuse her request—and it was finally the time to talk about it, to let go of this crushing weight on my heart. "I met them when I enlisted, there was Henry and Lyle, they were from different parts of Missouri, Henry joined from a sense of duty while Lyle joined to escape poverty, we stuck together durin' drills, some time later we met Noah, he was from a small farm in Kentucky, we were eatin' after a long march and he joined us one time, he had a knack for guns and showed us some technique to hit targets with hellish accuracy, and well, he just stuck with us and became part of our group. We became good friends ever since. We marched together, fought together, ate together, slept together. But… they died without me."</p>

<p>"What happened?" She asked, eyes widened by the last word.</p>

<p>I continued to pet and play with her hair, it helped her to relax—and it helped me too. I took a deep breath and continued. </p>

<p>"Durin' one mission we managed to track down a guerrilla's hideout. An old and long abandoned plantation house. Well, I suppose it wasn't really abandoned. We sieged the wretched house day and night, shot at the windows whenever they dared to peek, threw grenades to scare them away, shot anyone who tried to sneak and called for help. We wanted to soften them up before we stormed the place—we wanted them to starve, and we did."</p>

<p>"After a week or so they stopped shootin' at us, we took it as our sign to storm and end this. We split into two teams, one at the front door and another at the back. I was leadin' the former. When I gave them my mark we kicked the doors and poured in, throwin' grenades and shootin' at anythin' that might look like it would shoot at us. Most of the survivin' guerrillas surrendered immediately, but of course others refused and hunkered down in the rooms, so we went to clear each room—mostly with grenades. We lost some men that day but it was nothin' compared to the guerillas."</p>

<p>"But only one room remained with its door ajar, somethin' inside me told me it's empty and we got all the guerillas—but a shot almost that almost Lyle proved me wrong. The shot was soon followed by a young and scared voice callin' us Yankee scum. If he only stayed silent… The kid was no older than ten or twelve. They had a kid with them and we almost killed him."</p>

<p>"I ordered the men to wait, but some were displeased with my command. They wanted this whole ordeal to end and it didn't matter for them if the kid died or not. I can't believe there's people like this who roam around and call themselves civilized."</p>

<p>She listened with great care, like she understood my pain.</p>

<p>"I handed my gun to Noah and I told the kid that I'm comin' in with no weapons so he could trust me and show him that I had no ill intentions. It was a risky idea but I didn't see any other way to convince him I wasn't a threat. I was half expectin' to get shot the second I laid foot and that the both of us would end up dead and bleedin' on the rotten floor. But he didn't. It would've ended with the kid killed if it was someone else. But I refused that outcome. I slowly walked in the room like every step might set off a trap, not wantin' to startle or scare the kid, and then I saw him hidin' behind the bed, and it broke my heart. He was a small boy with rags wrapped around his skinny body, clumsily holdin' a rifle that didn't fit his small hands, he was shakin' and strugglin' to keep the heavy rifle steady and keep it on me. His finger itched to shoot, but his eyes were on the verge of tears, I crept closer to the kid, promisin' him it would be alright, that I won't hurt him—that no one would hurt him. I wouldn't allow it, I told him. I slowly took the gun away from him, he was on the verge of cryin', and he… Well, jumped on me and hugged me, tightly wrappin' his small arms around me and he cried and cried. I hugged him back reassurin' him everythin' will be alright, I didn't know what else to do."</p>

<p>"You're a kind man." She exhaled softly. Her words shock me. Kind. I've been described with many things. Traitor, bandit, killer, thief, godless and a villain. But this was the first time in a long while someone had called me kind—and it was from a beast of all things…</p>

<p>"Thanks," Scratched her behind the ear. "I don't hear that very often." She nuzzled me with her boney snout.</p>

<p>"What happened to the kid?" She was really invested in the story.</p>

<p>I sighed and stroked her hair, speaking became easier, but the pain remained. "I took the kid with me to Ahab, he was our officer and General Baker's younger brother, to see when I could take him to an orphanage while the men tending the wounded, rounded the bodies to bury and—survivors to execute. And to my shock the bastard said the kid would face the wall like the rest of the traitors." I said, trying to make an impression of him, and I got a chuckle out of her. "Yeah, he always talked like that, always tryin' to imitate his older—more feared—brother, but it always came off as forced and phony."</p>

<p>"'He's just a kid for fuck's sake!' I snapped at him, I couldn't believe what he just said. My friends too couldn't believe it. But what really shocked me was the complete indifference and the apathy most men had, they didn't care or say anythin' to oppose Ahab. It was beyond absurd to me."</p>

<p>"He demanded that I hand the kid over when I refused. The kid was scared and cryin' was the only thing he could do, clingin' on to me to protect him like I had promised, and I… I was scared too. He said it would be treason to disobey the orders of a commissioned officer and I would join him if I didn't hand him in this instant. I couldn't take it, the kid's cries and pleas, the officer shouts and threats, the men starin' and doin' nothin' about it. It was nerve wreckin' and I couldn't endure it any more. And when he tried to snatch the kid, that's when I broke, I…, well… I just… shot him. My revolver rose on its own and the barrel was already smokin' before I realized what I had done. Ahab dropped dead, shriekin' in pain like the pig he was. Before I could process what just happened—what I just did, one of his men drew his pistol on me to avenge his fallen officer, but before he could execute me, Henry shot him down like a dog." I sighed, I didn't want to continue with this, the mere memory haunts me, but her presence helped me. Talking about it felt less painful knowing someone was here with me. It was finally time for someone to hear me. </p>

<p>"That was the catalyst of what they call 'The one soldier mutiny' as they like to call it, but I wasn't alone, it was the four of us against the whole unit." Words stuck in my throat, talking was hard, but a glimpse at those human eyes eased the pain.</p>

<p>"Henry escorted me and the kid to the horses while Lyle and Noah stayed behind. The moment we jumped on the horses I heard a gunshot and a thud—like a sack had fallen. I looked back and saw Henry's motionless body layin' face-down in the mud with an open wound on his chest. I wanted to go and help him, I wanted to stay to avenge them. I wanted to die with them. But… I left. I left them to die and ran away." I felt like crying. Fighting both the shame and guilt inside me, hardening my heart not wanting to cry in her presence. But a tear escaped with the next word. "I was a coward that day. It should've been me, not them. I should've died that day."</p>

<p>"You did what you had to do. They wanted you to live. For the kid to live." She said, "No point in getting yourself killed."</p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes and whipped the premature tears. She's right. Dying would've made their sacrifice pointless. "I didn't look back and rode as fast and as far as I could, until I found myself in a town." I continued, talking became easier, as if a crushing burden was left of me. "I dropped the kid and gave him whatever money I had that day before leavin' the town immediately. I knew a bounty would be placed on my head soon and the army and all sorts of bounty hunters would come lookin' for me sooner or later. The only choice I had was the outlaw life, I think you know the rest."</p>

<p>"You wish you didn't help the boy?" She asked, it felt like I've been asked this before.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I do, but most times I don't." I told her. "Ahab had it comin', but my friends… They deserved better. And the kid too… I'm not sure I would be able to forgive myself and sleep with a clear conscience if I didn't do anything that day. Not only that I would let a kid get executed in cold blood, but I would also break my promise and betray him. Dyin' with the last thought in your mind that the whole world had betrayed you? I couldn't imagine a worse fate. But I still didn't feel like I did the right thing." As if I was able to sleep with a clear conscience after what I did, "As selfish as it may seem, I thought of Lillian that day, <em>what would she think of me if I let a kid die?</em> I thought to myself, and I still do."</p>

<p>Peaceful silence fell, she nuzzled me and placed her boney head on my lap, and I petted the furry parts of her head, her neck and behind her ears. She's getting really comfortable around me—and me as well. And I'm quite enjoying it—her probably more than me.</p>

<p>"When we parted ways…" I felt compelled to ask after a long minute of silence. "Did you hate me?…"</p>

<p>It took her a long moment to respond, "I hated myself." She finally said.</p>

<p>Poor girl. "Please don't."</p>

<p>"This body... I hate it... It's not mine. But I can't remember much before it. And this body is starting to feel... <em>too familiar</em>. Like it always had been mine. I hate it. When you left me... I thought you hated me. Feared me. Never wanted to see me ever again." She answered, looking away. "I was afraid—and still am. I fear I'm slowly losing my humanity. I fear I might forget everything about my past self—my true self. I fear that I might turn mad and become a mindless beast…"</p>

<p>"There's nothin' to be afraid of and I don't hate you." I continued to pet and play with her hair, it helped her to relax—it helped me too. "I'm here and I won't be goin' anywhere. Even though you don't remember or know who you were, you're still human, you're still human to me despite what the world would say."</p>

<p>Her eyes were lost in thoughts, looking away before looking up to me. "I had a dream." She said softly.</p>

<p>"What was it about?" I said in a matching tone.</p>

<p>"About my past self. It was foggy, but I was traveling in a carriage. I was sad and angry."</p>

<p>"Where were you goin'?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Her tone was sad and defeated. I shared her sadness.</p>

<p>"It's alright. You don't have to think about it." I told her, trying to comfort her to the best of my abilities.</p>

<p>"There was a fox chasing a bunny." She went on, there was a hint of a laugh in her voice, "He ran around trying to catch it. But hit his head and the bunny escaped. It looked funny. And I wasn't angry any more. Only sad."</p>

<p>"What caused you anger and sadness?" I went on stroking her hair, it was really soft.</p>

<p>"I was alone." She said, "No one to share my sorrow with. No one to share my happiness with."</p>

<p>I sighed. "I know how it feels. I know."</p>

<p>"Do you miss her?"</p>

<p>"I do…" I answered, Lillian was the only thing that lived in my mind, and this wolf is starting to share a place with her. "Remember that man you almost killed a few days ago?" She looked away when I mentioned him. "He said he would help deliver a letter to her, a last request sort of thing. He wrote it in his journal for me while I was imprisoned." I paused for a moment, "I wonder if he would keep his word, but I doubt it." </p>

<p>"Do you want him to deliver that letter?" Her eyes looked up to me.</p>

<p>"I'm honestly not sure," I shrugged, "Part of me wants her to know what happened to me, and another part is consumed by shame and just wants to disappear and never to be seen again, never see her again or let her know how low I had fallen." But… Micah might not do it, or… tell her about this beast…</p>

<p>She paused for a long moment as I gently scratched her behind the ear, "What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Well," Trying to remember what I had exactly said, "I told her what happened to me and what was about to happen. So here's what I told Micah to write." I told the lazy wolf what I could remember from my letter, but I feel like I had forgotten a word or two, but she got the jest of it.</p>

<p>"So, what do you think?" I asked, "Obviously I didn't have enough time to think about it more thoroughly and I was too tired to think straight."</p>

<p>"I like it." She exhaled, "You're a passionate man."</p>

<p>"You think so? thanks." I was a bit flattered by her words. "I hope she will like it and understand too." <em>if</em> she even received the letter.</p>

<p>We sat in silence for a long moment before she broke it with a question I wasn't prepared for. "Would Lillian like me?" She asked sheepishly.</p>

<p>It caught me off guard and made me pause with the petting, "I… I don't know." I answered, suddenly remembering what she was. I continued stroking her hair, but the motion was awkward and stopped feeling natural. "But she's a compassionate girl, if she knew you long enough like me she would like you too. I'm sure of it." My words felt hollow to me. She just reminded me of what I was doing—of what she was. Sitting with a hellish beast that killed dozens of men not long ago—killed them on my behalf. And the worst part is... It didn't bother me as much as it should. I feared I might be losing my humanity and getting detached and desensitized to this.</p>

<p>I had nothing to say or add, I stayed with her for a couple of minutes before standing to leave, I had to keep watch outside, I couldn't risk getting caught off guard in this state—and I needed some time alone…</p>

<p>"Don't go." She complained. Extending her arm and her claw caught my poncho.</p>

<p>"I'll be at the entrance, I won't go far."</p>

<p>"Don't leave me. Please." She pleaded. "Don't desert me. Please…"</p>

<p>"I won't. I promise." I assured the wolf woman, "But I have to be on the watch out to keep us safe—to keep you safe." I crouched and gave her a last touch before departure.</p>

<p>She didn't say anything but let go of me. I left the shelter and sat next to the bushes at the entrance, hugging the rifle all alone.</p>

<p>I felt weak and vulnerable without her, and she probably felt the same without me. I wanted to stay by her side and tell her everything would be alright—but nothing was alright. I'm lost and don't know where to go now, I don't belong anywhere. I can't just go back or keep wandering around with this creature. I don't know… I just… don't know…</p>

<p>The sun crept down extraordinarily slow, like it was teasing me, couldn't the time just pass any quicker? My back and butt stiffened from the uncomfortable ground and my mind kept torturing me, this beast, Lillian, and Micah. It's not easy, nothing is…</p>

<p>A sound came from the bush across of me and immediately grabbed my attention. The rifle rose automatically at the intruder and almost squeezed the trigger, but the thing revealed itself, and it was… a crow. And he cawed at me once, annoyed with my reaction, before walking towards the cave. The little fellow must've smelled the blood and came for a little bite.</p>

<p>I watched him with odd fascination. The bird didn't seem to be afraid of me as he walked to the entrance, he stopped for a moment and tilted his head. The little fellow had never seen anything like this wolf before, and he was curious about it. After a long minute of consideration and debating if the scraps of snake meat is worth it or not with that creature in there. The bird decided to finally go in, walking with his little confident steps. And when he disappeared it felt like he had been swallowed by the darkness.</p>

<p>After a few moments a lazy yet playful chuckle came out, "Hello little one." She said and murmured something I couldn't quite catch, but she seemed to enjoy having that crow around, and the crow didn't seem to be too bothered with her presence at all. At least she got someone to keep her company while I'm outside.</p>

<p>The crow occasionally cawed, and she let out a faint chuckle each time. They felt human, and they reminded me of her.</p>

<p>I missed Lillian. I want to see her one last time…</p>
===CHAPTER12===
<p>Dark, dark like the sun had never risen—but it was midday. The dark clouds absorbed most of noon's light and the trees did the rest on preventing what little sunlight that managed to escape their clutch. There was an eerie taste in the air, I didn't like it—but with Lillian, I felt safe.</p>

<p>She led the way and I followed, we're finally back in the wilderness like how we started. Getting as far as we could from the civilized world—back to the eerie woods once again. It seemed neither of us belonged or were welcomed anywhere near civilization. I grew to hate it anyway, as it hated me. But the trees this time were thicker and darker than before, it was hard to see anything beyond the flora. The wood felt like it would swallow me alive if I ventured one step too far away from her. And I had a feeling that these parts were foreign to her. I asked my navigator if she knew where she's going, but she didn't answer. Too focused on whatever she's after—or probably too proud to admit that she's lost. I can't blame her, I'd probably do the same if I was in her place.</p>

<p>The breeze was colder than usual too. I pulled the poncho for a little bit of extra warmth. It helped, but we have to find somewhere for winter or else we would freeze to death.</p>

<p>"Cold never bothered you?" I asked, trying to start a conversation. But she ignored me, still too focused on what she had in mind, whatever it was. I suppose the answer would be no anyway with how thick and long her fur is. Well, I suppose I won't freeze if I sleep in her embrace. She likes it anyway—and I like it too, as embarrassing as it might be.</p>

<p>She regained her original strength—most of it. She still seemed visibly tired and had a slight limp as she walked. But it didn't stop her. Hunger was a great motivator and what drove her. I would love to have something to eat as well.</p>

<p>Most of her wounds had healed, but the aftermath was there to remind me of her mortality. She's a tough one and nowhere near easy to kill—<em>but she could be killed</em>. That thought scared me, and being this close to losing her horrified me. I didn't know her for that long, but after what we had gone through, losing her felt like losing a dear old friend. </p>

<p>I kept following, hoping she's after food or prey of some sort. Ducking the branches trying to gouge my eyes. Some of the trees had odd shapes, branches extending like sinister claws ready to snatch unwary travelers—or strangle them in their sleep. I swear I saw them moving—and it wasn't the trick of the light. They moved, not like how they're supposed to—not like how wind manipulates them. They were creeping to catch me—ever so slightly when I'm not looking. But the moment I looked at them they ceased the movement. I rubbed my eyes, it's just in my head. I'm tired and hungry.</p>

<p>After a few moments I got my answer, a foul smell came assaulting from the direction she's going—which only grew stronger with each step. Was she following this scent? It smelled like rotten meat, and as we walked towards it the more sure I got it was a rotten carcass she's after. Her appetite was always great, hunger is the greatest cook I suppose. But I can't eat anything like her—even if I was as hungry as her.</p>

<p>Her pace quickened then went bolting as the stench became unmistakably of rotten flesh. I picked up my pace too trying to keep up with her but it was in vain, "Wait!" I called but she didn't listen, and soon she disappeared behind the trees. Damn it, not again. Hunger took over her senses.</p>

<p>Shielding my face, I ran after her not wanting to lose each other, the last thing I wanted was to get caught without her.</p>

<p>When the trees had finally ended and stepped outside the oppressive woods, I found myself in an empty and abandoned road surrounded by thick trees on each side, and right in the middle of it was a wagon, half buried in the mud—and two dead horses still attached to it, which my companion already had her maw buried in them—devouring the rotten meat with a never ending appetite.</p>

<p>I covered my mouth with the poncho, the stench was fouler up close and the sight wasn't any better. The half-decompose maggot-infested carcasses barely had any meat left on them but she didn't care and ate with great apatite—not caring with whom she shared her meal with.</p>

<p>I was about to tell her to stop but opted not to. It's probably the only food we could find for her. While my beast was ravaging the foul meat I directed my attention to the wagon. There were no signs of the drivers—or their corpses. The footprints were long gone to give any hints where they ran off to.</p>

<p>"You reckon they were the same people we passed by on our way to Valentine?" I asked her, the only response I got was the ravenous munching on meat.</p>

<p>They probably weren't. This road was days away from Valentine and way too close to the afflicted zones, no one is fool enough to wander here—well, no fool aside from me and her.</p>

<p>The wagon must've been stuck for a long while and the drivers abandoned it and never came back, they didn't even bother freeing the horses. Whatever that scared them is gone now, or it seems. But I wonder, was it worse than what I got with me?</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about the wagon, just a simple one with its cargo covered with old tattered sheets, obscuring dozens and dozens of boxes. <em>Please be food, I really don't want to share her meal.</em></p>

<p>Hoping for the best, I yanked the cover off to reveal the treasure, and a grin made its way on my face. <em>'Baked Beans'</em> nearly half of them read. The rest were an assortment of other canned goods, <em>Corn</em>, <em>Tomatoes</em> and <em>Peaches</em>. But what really caught my attention was a couple of boxes labeled <em>Bully Beef</em>. Thank god it was filled to the rim with food.</p>

<p>Unloading a box of beans and beef and setting them on the ground. They were heavier than expected, or the hunger had taken its toll on me. I took my knife and pried the boxes open, my hands were shaking slightly from both hunger and excitement. With the cover removed I took a can of beans and inspected it, <em>"As good as your Mama's beans."</em> a cartoon of an old looking man with a big mustache said on the can, I sighed, and my smile vanished. Damn it.</p>

<p>The cartoon aside, the can seemed in a good condition—although a bit dirty with a bit of rust around the edges starting to develop—but they didn't look bad at all, nor the expiration date<em>. '1898' </em>still got two more years on them.</p>

<p>Stabbing and opening the can, the beans looked in a good condition as well. Them and their tomato's water never looked so inviting and appetizing like this before. I scooped a handful of beans and stuffed them in my mouth. They were cold but I didn't care nor did it make them taste any less delicious. When I couldn't scoop any more I held the can up and poured the remaining beans in my mouth. Throwing it aside once it was empty—the clang grabbed Lillian's attention and looked up from the carcasses, tilting her stained ivory slightly at me. "What are you eating?" She asked.</p>

<p>"Canned food." I answered, picking a can of beef. "It seemed they were carrying a shit load of them and the wagon got stuck, but for whatever reason the drivers abandoned ship and ran on foot and didn't bother lookin' back."</p>

<p>She sniffed the air a couple of times, "A faint scent of undeads. But long gone."</p>

<p>I shrugged, "I suppose that's why they didn't come back." Twisting the opener on the side till the lid was off, revealing the pink paste of meat inside, it didn't look as appealing as regular meat, and there was a disgusting quality about it, but I ate it anyway. It tasted surprisingly similar to the real thing—But as soon as I was about to swallow the beef caused me to gag.</p>

<p>Despite the good taste it made me feel like puking. The stench in the back, the odd feel of the minced canned meat and what it felt like to eat. The grotesque images came flashing again—putting my hand on my mouth holding myself and trying my hardest not to throw up.</p>

<p>"Connor?" Concern filled her voice. I managed to hold it back and swallowed the beef, but God, I felt so sick.</p>

<p>"I'm alright I'm alright, it's just the texture is not exactly how I like it, but it tastes good." Trying my hardest not to empty my stomach, It did taste good, but meat started to repulse me, my mind refused to imagine it as anything but minced human meat.</p>

<p>She sniffed the air and took notice of the beef in my hand, "What is that?" She asked, creeping closer with her eyes pinned at the can.</p>

<p>"Bully Beef." I told her, "You remember havin' one of these before?" She didn't answer, "Here, take this one, they taste almost like the real thing." I handed it to her. I don't think I can eat anyway. Only the fresh meat I hunted myself or she hunted for me didn't disgust me. I guess it'll be beans and corn for me.</p>

<p>She held it clumsily with her large claws, almost slipping from her grasp but she managed to get a grip on it, sniffing the meat first, unsure of what it was, or perhaps she was trying to remember the scent and taste.</p>

<p>She took a bite once done examining the meat, but she didn't swallow immediately, instead trying to savor the taste and figure out the flavors in it. She seemed lost in thoughts and it was hard to read whether she liked it or not.</p>

<p>"Salty." She finally let out.</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" I asked, "I suppose it beats rotten meat."</p>

<p>She nodded, "Way better." Downing the can's content in her mouth.</p>

<p>"Well, glad you liked it." I put some cans in my satchel for later and I gave her another can of meat. She took it gladly.</p>

<p>I took a corn box and opened a can, mostly to drink the juice. But corn would be a nice snack too. While I would've preferred clean water, the corn water didn't taste that bad or weird.</p>

<p>Once she was done with the canned beef, she went to see what else was in the wagon, gawking at the boxes while I ate my corn, one in particular grabbed her attention. Her maw moved slightly.</p>

<p>"Peaches." She exhaled, tapping at the word then looking back at me. "Could you open it for me?" So she still remembers how to read, I suppose it's one of those things one can never forget—even if they forget themselves.</p>

<p>"So eager for a dessert?" I chuckled, throwing the empty can aside. I took the peaches box and opened it while she sat facing me and looked at it with hungry eyes. I opened a can and gave it to her—not before taking a slice for me first. It was really sweet and juicy.</p>

<p>She downed it immediately and threw the empty can.</p>

<p>"Another." She said, and I complied, handing her another one, which she was done with as soon as she got hold of.</p>

<p>"More." She demanded.</p>

<p>"Have some patience." I chuckled, opening another can and handing it over to the wolf lady.</p>

<p>"Sweet." She exhaled like she has been longing for it.</p>

<p>"Thankfully we have a shipment of sweets to your heart content, here." I handed her another and she gladly took it.</p>

<p>She has a massive sweet tooth, I can't really blame her, these peaches are so damn tasty and I suppose there's not so many sweet things for her laying around in the wild.</p>

<p>I opened a can for myself as well and enjoyed the sweet peaches. "You remember the last time you ate fruits or anythin' sweet?" I was a bit curious. She seemed to love peaches.</p>

<p>"The tea at the house." She said, extending her clawed hand for another can.</p>

<p>"That's it?" I gave her one, "That's a long damn while, Fruits don't grow in your woods?"</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head. Come to think of it, I haven't seen anything but Oak and Pine trees in these woods. "Meat is the only thing I eat. Sometimes fresh. Sometimes rotten…" She paused, looking away. "Sometimes animals. Sometimes…" She said so sheepishly, not daring to continue. She avoided looking at me, like she was ashamed of it. I knew what she was about to say and it made me feel uneasy.</p>

<p>"They were bad men and wanted to kill you—and me. I don't like killing—I hate it." She defended herself, but didn't even try to deny it. "It makes me feel like an animal. Like <em>A Monster</em>. But I can't help it. An unexplainable itch—a primal desire for blood demands it and it takes over and I lose control. <em>It drives me mad</em>."</p>

<p><em>An unexplainable itch, primal desire and losing control</em> she says... My doubt about her began to resurface again. Part of me wanted to believe she's a poor girl and in need of help, that she could be saved and find peace one day, but another part, <em>the logical part</em>, was screaming at me, she was far gone and beyond saving. I should leave her the first chance I get. But… I can't just abandon her.</p>

<p>"You don't hate me for killing those men, do you?" She asked, "They wanted to hurt you and kill you. I just… I just… wanted to help you…"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," I assured her, at the end of the day I'm alive because of her. But that didn't make me feel any better. Deep down some fear still lingered—fear that I might start losing my humanity like her. "I just wished it didn't end up like that... With that much bloodshed…" I can't say I feel bad for the soldiers, but the way they went out… it wasn't fit for a human. I killed my fair share of men, some were bad, others were not. And it haunts me.</p>

<p>Awkward silence loomed over us. I looked at the can at hand, not having the slightest idea what to say. She too avoided directly looking at me. She seemed ashamed of it. She would've ravaged the drivers bodies if they were here…</p>

<p>I sighed and gave her another can.</p>

<p>"Thanks." She said softly, she seemed a bit relieved and glad.</p>

<p>"Did you like peaches before… this?" I asked, trying to shift the topic to something less gloomy. She needs help—and I'm the only one who could help her.</p>

<p>"I think so." She answered, "But the sweetness is what I crave. It reminds me of better days. You like peaches too?"</p>

<p>"I do, but I prefer oranges and apples, green apples are the best." I told her, eating a slice of peaches, "But I ain't complainin', these peaches are so damn good."</p>

<p>She chuckled. "They do taste good. I like them." I offered her another can and she took it gladly. "But I want to try oranges and apples again. To remember their sweet taste. I think I liked oranges too."</p>

<p><em>She's more than just a mere monster,</em> I reminded myself. The way she laughed and talked, it was human. "I'll find you some oranges." I told her, there was the expression of a sad smile in her eyes if I knew one.</p>

<p>"Thanks." She said softly.</p>

<p>"Want another?" </p>

<p>She nodded and I gave her more peaches. We continued with this ordeal for a long while, I put a couple of cans for her in my satchel for later. I don't think we would find any abandoned wagons ripe for the taking like this any time soon—so we ate as much as we could. Her with the peaches and me with the beans, I don't think I could handle canned meat anytime soon. </p>

<p>We deserve a little break.</p>

<p> </p><hr>

<p> </p>

<p>Almost dozens of empty cans littered the road. I was about to hand her another can of sweet peaches but a gunshot went off in the distance. I reached for the guns on my hip and she went on full alert, her ears stood in an instant and pointed toward the source, her form took an aggressive stance, ready to kill that stranger if he dared getting any closer, but the shot was too far—another shot was fired.</p>

<p>It sounded like one man, it couldn't be the hunters, stealth was their style and they worked in teams. And it couldn't be the army either, or else they would have more fire power—unless it was Micah somehow getting lost in the same woods as us…</p>

<p>"We should investigate." I told her.</p>

<p>"No." She answered bluntly. "Bad idea." Before walking to the opposite direction of the gun fire.</p>

<p>"We can't just leave him!" She didn't look back and continued to march, only to stop once she realized I wasn't following.</p>

<p>"Come." sounding like she's asking rather than commanding.</p>

<p>"I can't." I answered, "What if they need help—"</p>

<p>"What if they kill you?" She said, looking at me with worried eyes.</p>

<p>"What if it's Micah? I need to make sure he's safe. Please."</p>

<p>She looked at the ground then back at me, "Is it about that letter?"</p>

<p>"No…" While it was in my mind, it wasn't the first thought in my mind, "I don't want more blood on my hands. Or yours…"</p>

<p>She looked lost in thoughts but it didn't make her change her initial plan of just leaving.</p>

<p>I stood and unslung the rifle, walking towards the gunshots. I had to help Micah, or whoever this stranger is.</p>

<p>She grumbled in disapproval but followed me nonetheless. I knew she wouldn't leave me.</p>

<p>The gunshots went on and on—louder and louder as we got closer. Another sound crept alongside the gunfire, the limp banging on wood and the unintelligible growls and moans of the dead.</p>

<p>"Many undeads." She remarked, sniffing the air. "We should leave."</p>

<p>"They're dumb and slow. We can handle them." I told her. Her response was to huff in disapproval. She really didn't want us to get involved in this.</p>

<p>Treading carefully not to get snuck on by any wandering undeads, we finally stumbled upon a small old cabin surrounded by a small herd of undeads mindlessly banging on the door and barricaded windows—a gun's end stuck out of the gaps to put the dead back to the ground. The shooter was taking their sweet time between each shot, not wanting to waste a single round.</p>

<p>Hiding behind the trees observing the situation, neither shooter or undead were aware of our presence. After a couple of shots and corpses falling the man ceased firing, they must've given up or ran out of ammunition. I wasn't sure if I had enough ammunition to help myself, I counted more than a dozen of those unholy beings. The sword would come in handy here.</p>

<p>"Stay here." I told her.</p>

<p>"Why?" Confused by my command, "There's too many of them. I could kill them."</p>

<p>"I don't want whoever is in there to shoot at you or me in case they see you." I answered, "Don't come unless I <em>need</em> your help—or if they turned out not to be so friendly."</p>

<p>"Careful." She didn't like my plan, "Please."</p>

<p>"I will." I said, unsheathing the sword in my right and a pistol in my left, emerging out the trees and shooting two undeads in the head, dropping back to the ground like a rag doll and grabbing the herd's attention away from the small cabin, turning to face me their emotionless stare, marching slowly and limply towards me. All I could see was the demonic hunger in their dead eyes, not the one you would find in an animal. It was something else, a never ending hunger for flesh that could never ever be satisfied.</p>

<p>Hacking the first and slashing the other, the undead put little to no fight as their decaying body lost their heads. But the fight wasn't ending soon. </p>

<p>Remembering my briefing the day before that disastrous hunt, <em>'Undeads are slow and dumb, one can simply outpace them by walking, their decaying bodies might appear weak, but some might possess the strength to match that of the living, and in rare cases, even overpowering them, but a one well placed bullet to the head or a hard strike are enough to kill them. One must be careful with them and never underestimate abilities, especially in herds, as their true strength lies in numbers.'</em> Numbers which were dwindling with each one I struck with the sword.</p>

<p>One after the other they fell, and with each fallen undead I grew more and more exhausted, those abominations were harder to put down than they appeared to, forcing me to shoot the last three remaining undeads. The woods were silent again, I imagined with the unholy noises gone it would be calming, but there was an odd feeling in the air, not a single noise came from the cabin.</p>

<p>"It's safe, you can come out." I called, panting and gasping. "They're gone, I killed them all." But no one answered me. I looked where I left my wolf, she was about to come out but I gestured for her to stay put.</p>

<p>"Hello? You're in there?" I called, approaching the door, "It's safe now." Knocking on the door and calling again, but only silence answered me. I began doubting if they're still in there. Did they escape from a window or a back door I hadn't noticed?</p>

<p>I reached for the knob and twisted it—a bit hesitant—to my surprise the door clicked open, whoever is in here doesn't seem to have the keys for this cabin. "I'm comin' in. Don't shoot." I said, slowly opening the door. "I mean you no harm, honest." But no answer came.</p>

<p>Lowering both pistol and sword—but still clutching on them. If someone was in there, spooking them was the last thing I wanted. I entered the place, and sunlight poured through the open door with me and seeped through the barricaded windows. The cabin was abandoned as expected, nothing was there, save for a stove and empty shelves, layers and layers of dust coated the floor and the shelves</p>

<p>The moment I took another step in I was sent crashing to the hard and dirty floor, slamming my forehead and causing me to lose hold of the weapons—I was tackled from behind by the very man I was trying to help. <br />
My gun fired the moment it hit the ground and the sword was thrown out of reach. Struggling on the floor with the attacker, clouds of dust filled the air, I couldn't see a damn thing as the dusted air filled my lungs. </p>

<p>Our grunts and gasping were the only things that filled the air as each one of us was trying to get the upper hand on the other. But it was too late—they grabbed my hair and slammed the back of my head as hard as they could, giving my attacker an opening to pin me down in a mount position. On top of me, I finally got a good glance at my attacker. The man was trying to save was… A woman—and she was about to hack me with a hatchet.</p>

<p>"WAIT WAIT WAIT!" I screamed, but my pleas did very little to stop the mad woman—her hatchet was so eager to plant itself in my face. My hand instinctively rose to stop the hatchet. Catching it by the short shaft mid swing, I felt the impact through my entire arm—it hurt like it had broken it.</p>

<p>I was about to open my mouth to calm the mad bitch but she punched me as hard as she could with her free hand, disoriented and dazed, she yanked the hatchet from my grasp and went for an overhead raising her the axe as high as she could with both arms, the only thing I saw in her face was contempt and eyes that only wished my doom.</p>

<p>I raised my hand again, meekly shielding my face from the incoming attack—but before the strike had a chance to fall, a hellish arm extended from the door and seized her off me by the arms. Snatching her outside, like the devil had swallowed her.</p>

<p>Screams and shrieks of terror mixed with vicious snarls came from the outside, "Wait!" I called, she's going to kill her, I need to stop it!</p>

<p>I grabbed the sword and pistol. My head throbbed where she hit me and everything was spinning. That bitch had a heavy hand. "Stop!" But the cries and snarls didn't stop.</p>

<p>"Stop!" I called again, feeling a wet and warm sensation creeping down my forehead to my left eye, she slammed my head so hard it bled. I stepped outside and I saw the screaming woman dangling and kicking violently desperately trying to stop the sharp fangs from meeting her tender skin.</p>

<p>A kick landed on Lillian's skull, only giving her more reason to kill her, she had enough with her frantic and useless struggle—grabbing a kick mid attack and drew her near the hungry maw.</p>

<p>"LILLIAN! STOP!" I roared, finally grabbing her attention—both their attention. "Don't kill her." She shot me with a disapproving look, and back at the woman, snarling at her. "Put her down. Please."</p>

<p>A mixture of confusion and terror drew on the attacker's face. At the mercy of a beast and gazing directly at death's eyes. The wolf lady gazed back, still considering killing the stranger or not. But she listened—thank God—and let go of her, causing the woman to fall on her butt—crawling on her back away from the beast without breaking sight with it. That was a close one. </p>

<p>"Damn it woman," I said, approaching the woman and whipping the blood off my head and eye, "Is that how you thank a man for savin' your life?" I finally got a better look at my attacker, she looked young—perhaps the same age as me—with rough yet pretty features. She had short messy dark hair that made her look like a man—my hair was longer than hers. Her frightened pale blue eyes went back and forth between me and Lillian, and couldn't decide on which one of us to focus on. The beast that almost killed her, or the strange man accompanying that beast.</p>

<p>"Save?!" She blurted in a husky voice, "You were—wait, it listened to you?! How—why did it listen to you?!" Lillian was the only thing she focused on.</p>

<p>"You're lucky you didn't kill me or knock me back there." Although it felt like she was close to. My head was spinning and blood only got worse as it kept getting in my eye and obscuring my vision. I whipped the blood. My right eye throbbed in pain where she had punched me. Her hand crept for the hatchet—thinking I hadn't noticed it.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do that if I were you." I warned, pointing the blade mere inches away from her throat. Her full attention went from the beast to the blooded sword—and me. Her hands retreated and put them where I could see them.</p>

<p>"Who are you? You're with the hunters?" I demanded, looking at her trying to get an idea who she's with. She wore a blue neckerchief and an old dark duster coat with an empty bandolier and pouches inside it. She had a big backpack with a blanket rolled on it. She didn't look like a hunter, perhaps a bandit or bounty hunter maybe?</p>

<p>"The hunters? You're the one wearin' their colors!" She pointed out.</p>

<p>"Answer the damn question!" I barked at her, Lillian snarled too, so eager to just rip the woman in half.</p>

<p>"I'm not with the hunters!" She blurted out fearful for her life. "I'm alone, no one is with me! Honest! I came scavengin' for anythin' to sell."</p>

<p>"All by yourself? I find that hard to believe. Why did you attack me?"</p>

<p>"I swear I'm alone! I don't know how to convince you but there's no one here with me. Please, it was a misunderstandin'. I didn't recognize you and saw you approachin' in a gray coat and thought you're with the hunters or a runaway, I saw you gesturin' for someone else and thought you're gonna kill me or rob me, it was a mistake and if—if I knew I wouldn't have done it!"  Knew that I meant no harm or knew about the beast?</p>

<p>I looked at Lillian, the only thing I could see was a desire for blood, her blood. <em>It doesn't have to be like this.</em></p>

<p>I sighed, retreating the sword away.</p>

<p>The look on her face looked like a surprised cat. "Thank you! Thank you!"  She seemed to genuinely think I was about to kill her or let her be food for the <em>monster</em>. But if she was with the hunters… I wasn't sure I could let her go…</p>

<p>"Don't make me regret it." Whipping the blood off the sword and sheathing it. "Or she'll make you." I offered her a hand to stand up.</p>

<p>She looked uncertain for a moment, but in the end she took my hand—and it hurt. "You won't, I swear." <em>It better be.</em> I could feel her still shaking.</p>

<p>Back on her feet, she wasn't only strong, but also tall, an inch or two shorter than me, getting a better look at her face, some of the fear was replaced with a glimmer of hope—but not entirely. She had a scar on the left side of her mouth, starting right under her nose and ending near her chin, looks like she had her fair share of fights—But the cut didn't ruin her pretty face, rather giving her a tough look without undermining her beauty. </p>

<p>"You did the right thing."</p>

<p>"I hope I did."</p>

<p>The woman's attention quickly directed at Lillian, giving her fearful yet curious look, and my monster returned the weird looks with a rumbling growl. If she had skin she would be baring her teeth now, but they were always out, always stained and always scary and threatening—for everyone but me.</p>

<p>"Easy there. You're scarin' her." I told Lillian. Her growls stopped but the eyes were filled with disdain and hate.</p>

<p>"It… Listened to you… How? How did you tame this thing?!"</p>

<p>Tame? "I hardly did any tamin'. She just… likes me." I shrugged.<br />
 <br />
"What?" She furrowed her brow in disbelief. Looking back at the monster that was about to kill her, eyeing her down trying to find anything that resamples a <em>'She' </em>in this beast.</p>

<p>"She tried to kill you." Lillian finally spoke, but the wolfish raspy voice had returned, it had been a while since last I heard it—almost forgetting about it.</p>

<p>Hearing her voice caused the woman to jump and jaw to drop. </p>

<p>"It—She can talk?!" She exclaimed, causing Lillian to shoot her a look that wished she was dead.</p>

<p>"Yes she can talk." </p>

<p>"Why did you attack?" She said with the wolf's voice.</p>

<p>"I told you! I saw you approaching and didn't recognize you. Thought you were with hunters!" She said, pointing at my gray coat.</p>

<p>"Well I ain't with them, not anymore anyway." I knew this coat would cause problems. "What you're doin' here alone anyway?"</p>

<p>"I was uh... Scavengin' for things to sell." She's not after me? Although she looked like a bounty hunter.</p>

<p>"All by yourself?"</p>

<p>"Attracts less attention and faster than workin' with a team," She answered, "Well, it goes smoothly most of the time."</p>

<p>"And I suppose this time ain't one of them."</p>

<p>"Yeah... I got lousy and they somehow followed me and ended up cornered in that cabin."</p>

<p>"Well, you're lucky we were passin' by—and more lucky I was with her." I said, and the woman's eyeing me suspiciously, thinking about something.</p>

<p>"And I'm thankful to you, but say... Your face doesn't look so strange to me. I feel we have met before." She took a closer look at me like she was studying my features. I didn't like it. "I don't know but I feel like I've seen your face before but I can't quite remember where…"</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken—"</p>

<p>"Conner," Lillian spoke suddenly, "Let's leave."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes widened and sparked as her suspicion was confirmed. <em>If she only stayed quiet…</em></p>

<p>"Well nice meetin' you miss," I said, turning back to retrieve my hat from the cabin "It's safe now and we need to be on our way—"</p>

<p>"Wait!" She exclaimed, grabbing my arm tightly before I could even step away. "You're Connor O'Reilly!" Lillian growled instantly—a deep demonic growl like she was one of Satan's dogs protecting their master—causing the woman to let go immediately. "I know you, you're the man who shot that officer!"</p>

<p>"And what you're gonna do about it? Try your luck with the bounty like the rest of them?" My hand ready to draw and the wolf is so eager to rip her heart out. "Tougher men before you tried it and where are they now if not six feet under? If I were you I would forget we ever met and be thankful some stranger I didn't know had saved my ass. And if anybody knew about this, about me and my whereabouts. And let me tell you, she would know. And I won't be here to make her stop."</p>

<p>She backed off trying to make herself less threatening, "Sorry I—that wasn't my intention at all… You should come with me and join my people." </p>

<p>"Come with you?" My right hand rested on the pistol's grip and the left whipped the blood off my eye. "You mean your gang?" She's inviting me to her gang like she didn't try to split my face in half two minutes ago.</p>

<p>"We're outlaws but our group isn't a <em>gang</em>," She said, "At least not in the traditional—"</p>

<p>"Sorry Miss but I'm not interested in bein' in a gang."</p>

<p>"We're not a gang! We're a group of free hunters."</p>

<p>"Free hunters?" I asked, tilting my head slightly like how Lillian always does. "Is there even a difference?" Even if there were, I don't want to spend my days here after monsters and undeads.</p>

<p>"We call ourselves '<em>The Free Hunters Pact</em>'." She answered, "We take contracts and do odd jobs in the afflicted zones since the corps won't do shit. Retrievin' valuable things, collectin' samples and bringin' beasts for scientists, takin' photographs for the press. And.. Well, huntin' trophies for collectors, anythin' that involves venturin' in the zones we do it."</p>

<p>"Sorry but I'm still not interested bein' in a gang with criminals, I have better things to do."</p>

<p>"You're a criminal." She was so quick to point that out, I was about to open my mouth but she went on. "And you joined the crops because they promised to pardon you, no? But your bounty was too high to just let you leave, so they decide to betray you and cash out on your reward. And somehow… you ended up with this beast of yours. Am I correct?" She was spot on.</p>

<p>"What's the difference between us and them?" She continued, "They allow the scum of the earth among their ranks, murderers, rapists and all sorts of mad men. We're only a bunch of poor folks down on our luck, thieves and deserters and such banded together in a world that hates us. Just like you, you belong with us, both of you. We need people like you with us."</p>

<p>"Wait, her too?" I was genuinely surprised she even included Lillian in her offer, she too was, eyes widening inside her skull.</p>

<p>"Yes her too," She seemed a bit unsure but didn't back down, "We could… We could help you get your revenge on the corps."</p>

<p>"I don't want revenge." While I would've loved to beat the ever living shit out of Oskar, I didn't care that much for revenge as it was never my goal, "I just want to escape and leave everythin' behind, and to find someone…." This might be my chance to finally reunite with Lillian, <em>the real Lillian</em>.</p>

<p>The woman seemed a bit surprised with my response, "We could help you with that, but you'll have to do us a favor first."</p>

<p>"What kind of favors?" I crossed my arms, another task I have to do. I suppose they're not that different from the corps.</p>

<p>"It's not up to me," She answered, "But they would decide once they meet you. Nick would probably have somethin' in mind for you—and her…"</p>

<p>"Nick? Is that your leader?"</p>

<p>"Kinda, but not really," She answered, shaking her head. "He's the one in charge of contracts and jobs, every hunter is free to do what they please, every man is their own master with us. But when it comes to jobs we all go to Nick, he acts as our middle man with clients."</p>

<p>Great, now I'm back at square one doing jobs for others. But this time I'm dealing with people operating outside the law, they wouldn't betray their own, would they? They would put themselves at risk if they tried to. And this time, I have someone to watch my back.</p>

<p>Whether I like it or not, these are my people, they won't betray me like the hunters or the law. <em>They need people like me</em> or as she says. I won't be staying with them long anyway, do this <em>favor</em> and leave them immediately.</p>

<p>"I don't like you." Lillian finally spoke, her voice was more wolf than human. Causing the woman to take a step back.</p>

<p>"It's alright," I calmed her, She looked at the woman with hate still in her eyes—the woman which I just realized I didn't know her name.</p>

<p>"My reputation seems to exceed me and you already know who I am, may I have the pleasure of knowin' your name?" More like displeasure, I whipped the blood off my face and my eye throbbed in pain. This shit was driving me insane.</p>

<p>"Antonia Volpe." She answered. "And nice meetin' you too, Connor. I hoped our first impression would have been a bit… friendlier than this." An Italian name, it was hard to tell as she had an extremely neutral accent.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Antonia, hm?" The woman looked offended that I asked the beast her opinion.</p>

<p>"She tried to kill you." The wolf voice took over.</p>

<p>"Yeah she did, but you stopped her and she said it was a misunderstanding." She seemed truthful to me. </p>

<p>"If she tries that again… I will kill her."</p>

<p>"But she won't try that again, right Antonia?" I wasn't sure I could fully trust her. But what are the alternatives?</p>

<p>"I won't, I promise." Fear crept in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Good." Lillian exhaled, but she didn't seem satisfied.</p>

<p>"So… It's a deal?" Antonia extended her hand to seal the deal with a handshake.</p>

<p>I shrugged, "As long as your people have honor among thieves I suppose." I accepted the gesture—gripping her hand firmly and pulling her closer, whispering in her ear. "But if you double cross me, well, I ain't sure I could stop her from maulin' you. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I do…" She tried to pull her hand away but I held it for a long moment before releasing it. I made my point clear. I was sick of people betraying me.</p>

<p>Once she was free, she took her backpack off and rummaged through it. "What happened earlier in the cabin, it was a mistake, a big mistake." She took a bandage roll from her backpack and offered it to me as a gesture of goodwill. "I hope you understand."</p>

<p>I took it and wrapped my head, finally putting an end to the blood from getting in my eye. "I hope I do."</p>

<p>"Also… Uh..." She said, rubbing the back of her neck and avoiding looking directly at me. "Sorry for givin' you a black eye."</p>
